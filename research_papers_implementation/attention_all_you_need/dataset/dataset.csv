"Until the late 12th century castles generally had few towers; a gateway with few defensive features such as arrowslits or a portcullis; a great keep or donjon, usually square and without arrowslits; and the shape would have been dictated by the lay of the land (the result was often irregular or curvilinear structures).","ⴰⵔ ⵜⵉⴳⵉⵔⴰ ⵏ ⵜⴰⵙⵓⵜ ⵜⵉⵙ 12, ⵙ ⵓⵎⴰⵜⴰ ⴷⵔⵓⵙⵏ ⵍⴱⵕⵓⵊ ⵉ ⵜⵖⵔⵎⴰⵜⵉⵏ, ⴷ ⵜⴼⵍⵡⵉⵏ ⵉⵍⴰⵏ ⵜⵉⴼⵔⵉⵙⵉⵏ ⵜⵉⵎⵣⵖⴰⵏⵉⵏ ⵉⴷⵔⵓⵙⵏ ⵣⵓⵏⴷ ⵜⵉⵅⴱⴰ ⵏ ⵜⴼⴰⵍⴰⵜⵉⵏ ⵏⵖⴷ ⴱⵓⵕⵜⵛⵓⵍⵍⵉⵙ; ⴰⵇⵔⴱⵓⵣ ⴰⵅⴰⵜⴰⵔ ⵏⵖⴷ ⴷⵓⵏⵊⵓⵏ, ⵉⵜⵜⵓⵎⵢⵓⵔ ⴰⴷ ⵉⴳ ⴰⵎⴽⴽⵓⵣ ⴱⵍⴰ ⵜⵉⵅⴱⴰ ⵏ ⵜⴼⴰⵍⴰⵜⵉⵏ; ⵜⴳⴰ ⵜⴰⵍⵖⴰ ⵏⵏⵙ ⵜⵜⵓⵙⴼⵜⴰ ⵏⵉⵍ ⵡⴰⴷⴷⴰⴷ ⵏ ⵡⴰⴽⴰⵍ (ⴷⴰ ⵜⴳⴳⴰ ⵜⵢⴰⴼⵓⵜ ⴳ ⴽⵉⴳⴰⵏ ⵏ ⵜⵉⴽⴽⴰⵍ ⵜⵓⵚⴽⵉⵡⵉⵏ ⵓⵔ ⵉⵜⵜⵓⵙⵓⴷⵙⵏ ⵎⵉ ⴼⵔⵖⵏ ⵉⵣⵔⵉⵔⵉⴳⵏ)."

"Most architectural historians regard Michelangelo's design of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome as a precursor to the Baroque style; this can be recognized by broader interior spaces (replacing long narrow naves), more playful attention to light and shadow, extensive ornamentation, large frescoes, focus on interior art, and frequently, a dramatic central exterior projection.","ⴳⴰⵏ ⴽⵉⴳⴰⵏ ⵏ ⵉⵏⵎⵣⵔⵓⵢⵏ ⵏ ⵜⵎⵙⴷⴰⴳⵜ ⴰⵙⵖⵉⵡⵙ ⵏ ⵎⴰⵢⴽⵍ ⴰⵏⵊⵉⵍⵓ ⵉ ⵜⴽⴰⵜⵉⴷⵔⴰⵜ ⵏ ⵓⴼⵓⵥⴰⵕ ⴱⵉⵜⵔⵙ ⴳ ⵕⵓⵎⴰ ⵣⵓⵏ ⴷ ⵜⴰⵣⵡⴰⵔⵓⵜ ⵏ ⵜⵎⴰⵎⴽⵜ ⵜⴰⴱⴰⵕⵓⴽⵉⵜ; ⵉⵖⵢ ⴰⴷ ⵉⵜⵜⵓⵢⴰⵙⵙⵏ ⵙ ⵜⵊⵓⵎⵎⵉⵡⵉⵏ ⵏ ⵓⴳⵏⵙⵓ ⴰⵎⵉⵔⵉⵡ (ⴰⵙⵏⴼⵍ ⵏ ⵢⵉⵍⵎ ⵉⵏⵢⴰⵎⴰⵏ ⵉⵖⵣⵣⵉⴼ), ⴷ ⵓⵙⴽⵓⵜⵜ ⵓⴳⴰⵔ ⵙ ⵓⵙⵉⴷⴷ ⴷ ⵓⵎⴰⵍⵓ, ⴷ ⵓⴷⵉⴽⵓⵕ ⴰⵎⵉⵔⵉⵡ, ⴽⵉⴳⴰⵏ ⵏ ⵜⵉⴽⴽⴰⵍ, ⵜⴰⴹⵓⵕⵉ ⵜⴰⴱⵕⵕⴰⵏⵜ ⵏ ⵡⴰⵎⵎⴰⵙ ⴰⴷⵕⴰⵎⵉ."

"For instance, Renaissance ideas emerged in Italy around 1425 and spread to all of Europe over the next 200 years, with the French, German, English, and Spanish Renaissances showing recognisably the same style, but with unique characteristics.","ⵅⴼ ⵓⵎⴷⵢⴰ, ⴼⴼⵖⵏ ⴷ ⵜⴽⵜⵉⵢⵉⵏ ⵏ ⵓⵣⵎⵣ ⵏ ⵜⵏⴽⵔⴰ ⴳ ⵉⵟⴰⵍⵢⴰ ⴰⵜⵜⴰⵢ ⵏ ⵓⵙⴳⴳⵯⴰⵙ ⵏ 1425 ⴰⵍⵍⵉⴳ ⵜⴰⵖ ⵜⵉⵙⴳⴳⵉⵏ ⴰⴽⴽⵯ ⵏ ⵓⵕⵓⴱⴱⴰ ⴳ 200 ⵏ ⵓⵙⴳⴳⵯⴰⵙ, ⵙⵙⴽⵏⴻⵏⵜ ⵜⵏⴽⵔⵉⵡⵉⴱ ⵜⴰⴼⵕⴰⵏⵙⵉⵙⵜ ⴷ ⵜⴰⵍⵎⴰⵏⵉⵜ ⴷ ⵜⵏⴳⵍⵉⵣⵉⵜ ⴷ ⵜⵚⴱⵍⵢⵓⵏⵉⵜ ⵢⴰⵜ ⵏ ⵜⵎⴰⵎⴽⵜ, ⵎⴰⴽⴰ ⴽⵓ ⵢⴰⵜ ⵙ ⵎⴰ ⵙ ⵜⵙⵜⵢ."

"It also proposes the three fundamental laws that architecture must obey, in order to be so considered: firmitas, utilitas, venustas, translated in the 17th century by Sir Henry Wotton into the English slogan firmness, commodity and delight (meaning structural adequacy, functional adequacy, and beauty).","ⵉⵎⴽⵉⵏⵏⴰ ⴷ ⵉⴳⵔⴰ ⴰⵍⵜⵓ ⵉⵙⵍⴳⴰⵏ ⵉⴷⵙⵍⴰⵏⵏ ⵙ ⴽⵕⴰⴹ ⵎⵉ ⵉⵅⵙⵙⴰ ⴰⴷ ⵉⴹⴼⵕ ⵓⵜⵡⴰⵍ ⴰⵎⵙⴷⴰⴳ, ⵜⴰⴼ ⴰⴷ ⵜ ⴰⵙⵉⵏ: ⴼⵉⵔⵎⴰⵜⴰⵙ, ⵖⵉⵏⵓⵙⵜⴰⵙ, ⵓⵜⵉⵍⵉⵜⴰⵙ, ⵉⵙⵙⴰⵖⵍ ⵜⵏ ⵀⵉⵏⵔⵉ ⵡⵓⵜⵓⵏ ⴳ ⵜⵙⵓⵜⴰ ⵜⵉⵙⵙ 17 ⵖⵔ ⵜⴰⵣⵓⵍⵜ ⵜⴰⵏⴳⵍⵉⵣⵉⵜ ⴰⵙⵜⴰⵡ ⴷ ⵜⵎⵜⵜⴰ ⴷ ⵓⵎⴷⴰⵣ (ⵙ ⵓⵏⴰⵎⴽ ⵏ ⵜⵣⵎⵔⵜ ⵏ ⵜⵙⵇⵇⵓⵍⵉⵏ ⴷ ⵜⵣⵎⵔⵜ ⵜⴰⵣⵣⵓⵍⴰⵏⵜ, ⴷ ⵡⴰⵥⵍⵢ)."

"Gothic architecture (or pointed architecture) is an architectural style that was particularly popular in Europe from the late 12th century to the 16th century, during the High and Late Middle Ages, surviving into the 17th and 18th centuries in some areas.","ⵜⵎⵙⴷⴰⴳⵜ ⵜⴰⵇⵓⵟⵉⵜ (ⵏⵖ ⵜⴰⵎⵙⴷⴰⴳⵜ ⵜⴰⵎⴷⴱⴱⴻⴱⵜ) ⵜⴳⴰ ⵜⴰⵎⴰⵎⴽⵜ ⵏ ⵜⵎⵙⴷⴰⴳⵜ ⵉⵍⵍⴰⵏ ⴽⵉⴳⴰⵏ ⴳ ⵓⵕⵓⴱⴱⴰ ⴳ ⵓⵕⵓⴱⴱⴰ ⴳ ⵜⴳⴰⵔⴰ ⵏ ⵜⵙⵓⵜⴰ ⵜⵉⵙ 12 ⴰⵔ ⵜⵉⵙ 16, ⴳ ⵓⵣⵎⵣ ⴰⵏⴰⵎⵎⴰⵙ ⴰⵎⴰⵊⵊⴳⴰⵍ ⴷ ⵓⵎⴳⴳⴰⵔⵓ, ⵉⴷⵓⵙ ⴰⵔ ⵜⴰⵙⵓⵜⴰ ⵜⵉⵙ 17 ⴷ ⵜⵉⵙ 18 ⴳ ⴽⵔⴰ ⵏ ⵡⴰⵏⵙⵉⵡⵏ."

"In central Europe, the High Gothic style appeared in the Holy Roman Empire, first at Toul (1220–), whose Romanesque cathedral was rebuilt in the style of Reims Cathedral; then Trier's Liebfrauenkirche parish church (1228–), and then throughout the Reich, beginning with the Elisabethkirche at Marburg (1235–) and the cathedral at Metz (c.1235–).","ⴳ ⵡⴰⵎⵎⴰⵙ ⵏ ⵓⵕⵓⴱⴱⴰ, ⵜⴼⴼⵖ ⴷ ⵜⵎⴰⵎⴽⵜ ⵜⴰⵇⵓⵟⵉⵜ ⵜⴰⵎⴰⵊⵊⴳⴰⵍⵜ ⴳ ⵜⵎⴱⵕⴰⵟⵓⵕⵜ ⵜⴰⵕⵓⵎⴰⵏⵉⵜ ⵜⴰⴼⵓⵥⴰⵕⵜ, ⵜⵉⵣⵡⵉⵔⵉ ⴳ ⵜⵓⵍ (1220–), ⴳ ⵜⴻⵜⵜⵢⴰⵍⵙ ⵜⵉⵙⴽⵉ ⵏ ⵜⴽⴰⵜⵉⴷⵕⴰⵜ ⵏⵏⵙ ⵎⵎ ⵜⵎⴰⵎⴽⵜ ⵜⴰⵕⵓⵎⴰⵏⵙⴽⵉⵜ ⵅⴼ ⵜⴽⴰⵜⵉⴷⵕⴰⵜ ⵔⵉⵎⵙ; ⴳ ⵡⵉⵙ ⵙⵉⵏ ⴳ ⵜⴽⴰⵏⵉⵙⴰⵜ ⵏ ⵉⵙⵎⴳⴰⵏ ⵜⵔⵉⵔ ⵍⵉⴱⴼⵔⵓⵢⵏⴽⵉⵔⵛ (1228–), ⴷ ⴼⴼⵉⵔ ⴰⵙ ⴰⵏⵙⵉⵡⵏ ⴰⴽⴽⵯ ⵏ ⵔⴰⵢⵅ, ⵙⴳ ⵜⴽⴰⵏⵉⵙⴰⵜ ⵉⵍⵉⵣⴰⴱⵉⵜⴽⵉⵔⵛ ⴳ ⵎⴰⵔⴱⵓⵔⴳ (1235–) ⴷ ⵜⴽⴰⵜⵉⴷⵕⴰⵜ ⴳ ⵎⵉⵜⵣ (c.1235–)."

"Other characteristics of the High Gothic were the development of rose windows of greater size, using bar-tracery, higher and longer flying buttresses, which could reach up to the highest windows, and walls of sculpture illustrating biblical stories filling the facade and the fronts of the transept.","ⴽⴽⴰⵏⵜ ⵜⴼⵉⵔⴰⵙ ⵢⴰⴹⵏ ⵏ ⵜⵇⵓⵟⵉⵜ ⵜⴰⵎⴰⵊⵊⴳⴰⵍⵜ ⴳⴰⵏⵜ ⴰⵙⴱⵓⵖⵍⵓ ⵏ ⵉⵙⵕⵥⴰⵎ ⵏ ⵜⵍⵊⵊⵉⴳⵉⵏ ⵜⵉⵅⴰⵜⴰⵔⵉⵏ, ⵙ ⵓⵙⵡⵓⵔⵉ ⵏ ⵉⴷⵉⴽⵓⵕⵏ ⵉⵎⴰⴽⴰⵣⵏ, ⴷ ⵜⵙⵏⵏⵓⵍⴰ ⵢⵓⵢⵍⵍⴰⵏ ⵜⵉⵅⴰⵜⴰⵔⵉⵏ ⴷ ⵜⵎⴰⵊⵊⴳⴰⵍⵉⵏ, ⵏⵏ ⵉⵜⵜⴰⵡⴹⵏ ⵉⵙⵕⵥⴰⵎ ⵉⵎⴰⵊⵊⴳⴰⵍⵏ, ⴷ ⵉⴳⵓⴷⴰⵔ ⵉⵜⴽⴰⵔⵏ ⵙ ⵉⴳⵣⴰⵢⵏ ⵉⵙⵙⴽⴰⵏⵏ ⵜⵉⵏⴼⵓⵙⵉⵏ ⵜⵉⵎⴽⴽⵓⵙⴰ ⵉⴷⵍⴰⵏ ⵓⴷⵎⴰⵡⵏ ⵏ ⵡⴰⵏⵙⴰ."

"Churches with features of this style include Westminster Abbey (1245–), the cathedrals at Lichfield (after 1257–) and Exeter (1275–), Bath Abbey (1298–), and the retro choir at Wells Cathedral (c.1320–).","ⵙⵎⴰⵏⴻⵏⵜ ⵜⴽⴰⵏⵉⵙⴰⵜⵉⵏ ⵉⴷ ⵎⵎ ⵜⴼⵉⵔⴰⵙ ⵜⵓⵙⵜⵉⵢⵉⵏ ⵉ ⵜⵎⴰⵎⴽⵜ ⴰⴷ ⴰⴷⴷⵉⵔ ⵏ ⵡⵉⵙⵜⵎⵉⵏⵙⵜⵔ (1245–), ⴷ ⵜⴽⴰⵜⵉⴷⵕⴰⵜⵉⵏ ⴳ ⵍⵉⵜⵛⴼⵉⵢⵉⵍⴷ (ⴼⴼⵉⵔ ⵏ 1257-), ⴷ ⵉⴽⵙⵜⵔ (1275-), ⴷ ⴰⴷⴷⵉⵔ ⵏ ⴱⴰⵜ (1298-), ⴷ ⵜⵉⵍⴰⵍⵜ ⵜⴰⵇⴱⵓⵔⵜ ⴳ ⵜⴽⴰⵜⵉⴷⵕⴰⵜ ⵡⵉⵍⵣ (c.1320-)."

"They were also sometimes used for more practical purposes, such as to bring transverse vaults to the same height as diagonal vaults, as in the nave and aisles of Durham Cathedral, built in 1093.","ⴷⴰ ⵜⴻⵜⵜⵓⵙⵡⵓⵔⵉ ⴳ ⴽⵔⴰ ⵏ ⵜⵉⴽⴽⴰⵍ ⵉ ⵉⵙⵓⵖⴰⴷ ⵉⵍⴰⵏ ⵜⴰⵡⵓⵔⵉ, ⵣⵓⵏ ⴷ ⴰⵏⵣⵣⵓⵖ ⵏ ⵜⵇⵓⴱⴱⴰ ⵜⵉⵎⴰⵍⴷⴰⵢⵉⵏ ⵖⵔ ⵢⴰⵜ ⵏ ⵜⴰⵜⵜⴰⵢⵜ ⵏ ⵜⵇⵓⴱⴱⴰ ⵉⴳⴳⵓⵙⵙⵏ, ⴰⵎ ⵉⵖⵣⵣⴰⵍⵏ ⴷ ⵉⵙⴰⴽⴰⵜⵏ ⵏ ⵜⴽⴰⵜⵉⴷⵕⴰⵜ ⴷⵓⵕⵀⴰⵎ, ⵉⵜⵜⵓⵙⴽⴰⵏ ⴰⵙⴳⴳⵯⴰⵙ ⵏ 1093."
"Unlike the semi-circular barrel vault of Roman and Romanesque buildings, where the weight pressed directly downward, and required thick walls and small windows, the Gothic rib vault was made of diagonal crossing arched ribs.","ⵎⴳⴰⵍ ⵏ ⵜⵃⵎⵎⴰⵕⵉⵏ ⵜⵉⵡⵍⴻⵍⵍⵓⵜⵉⵏ ⵜⵉⵣⴳⵏⵡⵔⴻⵔⵔⴰⵢⵉⵏ ⵏ ⵜⵓⵙⴽⵉⵡⵉⵏ ⵜⵉⵕⵓⵎⴰⵏⵉⵜⵉⵏ, ⴳ ⵜⴻⵜⵜⵉⵍⵉ ⵜⴰⵙⵜⵍⵉ ⵙⵔⵉⴷ ⵙ ⵉⵣⴷⴰⵔ, ⴰⵔ ⵜⵜⴻⵜⵜⵔ ⵉⵖⵔⴰⴱⵏ ⵉⵣⵓⵔⴰⵔⵏ ⴷ ⵉⵙⵕⵥⴰⵎ ⵉⵎⵥⵥⵢⵏⵏ, ⴳⴰⵏⵜ ⵜⵃⵎⵎⴰⵕⵉⵏ ⵜⵉⵇⵓⵟⵉⵜⵉⵏ ⵜⵉⵎⴳⵓⵔⴰⵏⵉⵏ ⵙⴳ ⵉⵖⵙⴷⵉⵙⵏ ⵉⵣⴳⵏⵡⵔⴻⵔⵔⴰⵢⵏ ⵉⵎⵢⴰⴱⴱⴰⵢⵏ."
The outward thrust against the walls was countered by the weight of buttresses and later flying buttresses.,ⵜⴻⵜⵜⵓⴳⴰ ⵜⵏⴰⵍⵉⵜ ⴷ ⵜⵔⴰⵔⵉⵜ ⵙⴳ ⴱⵕⵕⴰ ⵉ ⵉⵖⵔⴰⴱⵏ ⵙ ⵜⴰⵙⵜⵍⵉ ⵏ ⵜⵙⵏⵏⵓⵍⴰ ⴷ ⵜⵙⵏⵏⵓⵍⴰ ⵢⵓⵢⵍⵍⴰⵏ ⴳ ⵡⴰⵢⴹ ⵓⵣⵎⵣ.

"The alternating rows of alternating columns and piers receiving the weight of the vaults was replaced by simple pillars, each receiving the same weight.","ⵜⵜⵓⵏⴼⵍⵏ ⵉⴷⵔⵙⵏ ⵉⵜⵜⵎⵡⴰⵍⴰⵏ ⵏ ⵜⵔⵙⴰⵍ ⴷ ⵉⵙⴰⵍⵉⵜⵏ ⴷ ⵉⵜⵜⵎⵡⴰⵍⴰⵏ ⵉⵜⵜⴰⵎⵥⵏ ⵜⴰⵙⵜⵍⵉ ⵏ ⵜⵇⵓⴱⴱⴰ ⵙ ⵜⵔⵙⴰⵍ ⵜⵉⴼⵔⴰⵔⵉⵏ, ⴽⵓ ⵢⴰⵜ ⴷⵉⴳⵙⵏⵜ ⵜⵓⵙⵢ ⵢⴰⵜ ⵜⴰⵙⵜⵍⵉ."
"The first of these new vaults had an additional rib, called a tierceron, which ran down the median of the vault.","ⴽⴽⴰⵏⵜ ⵜⵇⵓⴱⴱⴰ ⴰⴷ ⵜⵉⵎⴰⵢⵏⵓⵜⵉⵏ ⵍⴰⵏⵜ ⵢⴰⵏ ⵉⵖⵙⴷⵉⵙ ⵢⴰⴹⵏ, ⵉⵍⴰⵏ ⴰⵙⵙⴰⵖ ⵏ ⵜⵉⵔⵙⵔⵓⵏ, ⵉⵜⵜⴷⴷⵓⵏ ⴷⴷⴰⵡ ⵏ ⵡⴰⵎⵎⴰⵙ ⵏ ⵜⵃⵎⵎⴰⵕ."

"A second type was called a reticulated vault, which had a network of additional decorative ribs, in triangles and other geometric forms, placed between or over the traverse ribs.","ⴰⵏⴰⵡ ⵡⵉⵙ ⵙⵉⵏ ⵉⵍⴰ ⴰⵙⵙⴰⵖ ⵏ ⵜⵃⵎⵎⴰⵕⵜ ⵎⵎ ⵜⵔⴰⵜⵙⴰ, ⴰⵏⴰⵡ ⴰⴷ ⵉⵍⴰ ⵉⵖⵣⴷⵉⵙⵏ ⵉⴷⵉⴽⵓⵕⵏ ⵢⴰⴹⵏ, ⴳ ⵜⵎⴽⵕⴰⴹⵉⵏ ⴷ ⵜⴰⵍⵖⵉⵡⵉⵏ ⵜⵉⵎⵜⵡⴰⵍ ⵢⴰⴹⵏ, ⵉⵍⵍⴰⵏ ⴳⵔ ⵏⵖ ⴷ ⴰⴼⵍⵍⴰ ⵏ ⵉⵖⵣⴷⵉⵙⵏ ⵉⵏⵏⴼⵙⵔⵏ."

"They were used later at Sens, at Notre-Dame de Paris and at Canterbury in England.","ⵜⴻⵜⵜⵓⵙⵡⵓⵔⵉ ⴳ ⵡⴰⵢⴹ ⵓⵣⵎⵣ ⴳ ⵙⴰⵏⵙ, ⴳ ⵏⵓⵕⵜ-ⴷⴰⵎ ⴷⵓ ⴱⴰⵔⵉⵙ ⴷ ⴽⴰⵏⵜⵉⵔⴱⵓⵔⵉ ⴳ ⵉⵏⴳⵍⴰⵜⵉⵕⵕⴰ."
"In the High Gothic period, a new form was introduced, composed of a central core surrounded several attached slender columns, or colonettes, going up to the vaults.","ⴳ ⵓⵣⵎⵣ ⴰⵇⵓⵟⵉ ⴰⵎⴰⵊⵊⴳⴰⵍ, ⵜⴻⵜⵜⵙⵏⴰⵍ ⵜⵍⵖⴰ ⵜⴰⵎⴰⵢⵏⵓⵜ, ⴳ ⵉⵍⵍⴰ ⵡⴰⵎⵎⴰⵙ ⵎⵉ ⵜⵜⵉⵏⵜ ⵜⵔⵙⴰⵍ ⵉⴷⵓⵙⵏ ⵉⵎⵎⵣⴷⴰⵢⵏ, ⵏⵖ ⴷ ⵜⵉⵎⴷⵓⵔⵔⵓⵢⵉⵏ, ⴷⴰ ⵜⵜⴰⵍⵉⵏⵜ ⵖⵔ ⵜⵇⵓⴱⴱⴰ."
"In England, the clustered columns were often ornamented with stone rings, as well as columns with carved leaves.","ⴳ ⵉⵏⴳⵍⴰⵜⵉⵕⵕⴰ, ⴽⴽⴰⵏⵜ ⵜⵔⵙⴰⵍ ⵏ ⵜⵇⵙⵙⵓⵍⵉⵏ ⴷⴰ ⵜⵜⵓⴷⵉⴽⵓⵕⴰⵏⵜ ⵙ ⵜⵡⵔⴻⵔⵔⴰⵢⵉⵏ ⵏ ⵓⵥⵕⵓ, ⴷ ⵜⵔⵙⴰⵍ ⴷ ⵜⴼⵔⵉⵡⵉⵏ ⵜⵉⵎⴳⵣⴰⵢ."
"In place of the Corinthian capital, some columns used a stiff-leaf design.","ⴳ ⵓⴷⵖⴰⵔ ⵏ ⵜⵎⴰⵏⵖⵜ ⵜⴰⴽⵓⵕⵓⵏⵜⵉⵜ, ⵜⵜⵓⵙⵡⵓⵔⵉⵏ ⵢⵉⴷⵙ ⵏ ⵜⵔⵙⴰⵍ ⵏ ⵓⵙⵖⵉⵡⵙ ⴱⵓ ⵜⴼⵔⵉⵡⵉⵏ ⵜⵉⵖⵓⵔⴰⵔⵉⵏ."
"In later structures, the buttresses often had several arches, each reaching in to a different level of the structure.","ⴳ ⵜⵙⵇⵇⵓⵍⵉⵏ ⵜⵉⵏⴹⴼⴰⵕⵉⵏ, ⵉⵍⵍⴰ ⵉ ⵜⵔⵙⴰⵍ ⴽⵉⴳⴰⵏ ⵏ ⵜⴰⵙⴽⵉⵡⵉⵏ, ⴽⵓ ⵢⴰⵜ ⴷⵉⴳⵙⵏⵜ ⴷ ⵓⵙⵡⵉⵔ ⵏⵏ ⵜⵜⴰⵡⴹ ⴳ ⵜⵙⵇⵇⵓⵍⵜ."
The arches had an additional practical purpose; they contained lead channels which carried rainwater off the roof; it was expelled from the mouths of stone gargoyles placed in rows on the buttresses.,ⵖⵓⵔ ⵜⴰⵙⴽⵉⵡⵉⵏ ⴰⵡⵜⵜⴰⵙ ⴰⵎⵙⵡⵓⵔⵉ ⵢⴰⴹⵏ; ⵍⵍⴰⵏⵜ ⴷⵉⴳⵙⵏⵜ ⵜⴰⵖⴰⵙⵉⵏ ⵏ ⵓⴳⴰⵔⵉ ⵉⵙⵙⵓⴼⵓⵖⵏ ⴰⵎⴰⵏ ⵏ ⵓⵏⵥⴰⵔ ⵙⴳ ⵜⴷⵓⵍⵉ;ⵜⵥⵥⵍ ⵜ ⵙⴳ ⵉⵎⴰⵡⵏ ⵏ ⵜⵙⵎⵓⵜⵜⵔⵜ ⵏ ⵉⵙⵍⵍⵉⵡⵏ ⵉⵜⵜⵓⴳⴰⵏ ⴷ ⵉⴷⵔⵙⵏ ⵅⴼ ⵜⵉⵔⵙⴰⵍ.
"They also had a practical purpose; they often served as bell towers supporting belfries, whose bells told the time by announcing religious services, warned of fire or enemy attack, and celebrated special occasions like military victories and coronations.","ⵉⵍⵍⴰ ⵖⵓⵔⵙⵏ ⴰⵍⵜⵓ ⵢⴰⵏ ⵓⵙⵓⵖⴷ ⴰⵎⵡⵓⵔⵉ; ⵍⵍⴰⵏ ⴷⵉⴳⵙⵏ ⵉⵙⵔⵙⴰⵔⵏ ⵉⵍⵙⵖⵏ ⵙ ⵜⵖⵔⵎⴰⵜⵉⵏ, ⵉⵙⵔⵙⴰⵔⵏ ⴰⴷ ⵍⴰⵏ ⵜⴰⵡⵓⵔⵉ ⵏ ⵜⵖⵓⵔⵉ ⵙ ⵜⵡⵓⵔⵉⵡⵉⵏ ⵏ ⵓⵙⵖⴰⵏ, ⴰⵔ ⴰⴽⴽⴰⵏⵜ ⵜⴰⵖⴹⴼⵜ ⵉⴳ ⵜⵍⵍⴰ ⴽⴰ ⵏ ⵜⴰⵖⵓⵙⵜ ⵏⵖ ⴽⴰ ⵏ ⵓⴽⵛⵛⵓⵎ ⵏ ⵓⵙⵏⴳⵓ, ⴰⵔ ⵙⴼⵓⴳⵍⵓⵏ ⵙ ⵜⵉⵍⴰⵍ ⵣⵓⵏ ⴷ ⵜⵉⵔⵏⴰⵡⵉⵏ ⵜⵉⵙⵔⴷⴰⵙⵉⵏ ⴷ ⵓⵙⵎⵖⵔ."
"Since cathedral construction usually took many years, and was extremely expensive, by the time the tower were to be built public enthusiasm waned, and tastes changed.","ⵉⴷⴷⵖ ⵜⴻⵜⵜⵔ ⵜⵉⵙⴽⵉ ⵏ ⵜⴽⴰⵜⵉⴷⵕⴰⵜ ⵉⵙⴳⴳⵯⴰⵙⵏ, ⵜⵛⵛ ⵡⴰⵀⵍⵉ, ⵉⵏⵏⴳⵣⴰ ⵡⴰⵚⵚⴰⴱ ⵉⵙⵙⵏⴼⵍ ⵓⵎⴹⴰⵢ ⴳ ⵡⴰⴽⵓⴷ ⴳ ⵉⵔⴰ ⴰⴷ ⵜⴻⵜⵜⵓⴳ ⵜⵉⵙⴽⵉ ⵏ ⵜⵖⵔⵎⵜ."
Chartres would have been even more exuberant if the second plan had been followed; it called for seven towers around the transept and sanctuary.,ⵉⴽⴽⴰ ⵛⴰⵔⵜⵔ ⴰⴷ ⵉⵙⵡⵓⵔⵉ ⵓⴳⴰⵔ ⵎⵔ ⴹⴼⴰⵕⵏ ⵜⴰⴱⵔⵉⴷⵜ ⵜⵉⵙ ⵙⵏⴰⵜ; ⵉⵛⵉⵍ ⴰⴷ ⵙⴰ ⵏ ⵜⵖⵔⵎⴰⵜⵉⵏ ⵅⴼ ⵢⵉⴼⵔ ⴷ ⵓⴷⵖⴰⵔ ⵏ ⵓⴼⵔⴰ.

"In Normandy, cathedrals and major churches often had multiple towers, built over the centuries; the Abbaye aux Hommes (begun 1066), Caen has nine towers and spires, placed on the facade, the transepts, and the centre.","ⴳ ⵏⵓⵕⵎⴰⵏⴷⵉ, ⵍⵍⴰⵏⵜ ⵖⵓⵔ ⵜⴽⴰⵜⵉⴷⵕⴰⵜⵉⵏ ⴷ ⵜⴽⴰⵏⵉⵙⴰⵜⵉⵏ ⵜⵉⵎⵇⵔⴰⵏⵉⵏ ⵜⵖⵔⵎⴰⵜⵉⵏ ⵜⵜⵓⵙⴽⴰⵏⵉⵏ ⵅⴼ ⵜⵙⵓⵜⵉⵡⵉⵏ; ⴳ ⴰⴱⴱⴰⵢ ⵓⵣ ⵓⵎ (Abbaye aux Hommes) (ⵉⵏⵜⴰ ⴳ 1066), ⵜⵍⵍⴰ ⴳ ⴽⴰⵢⵏ (Caen) ⵜⵥⴰⵜ ⵏ ⵜⵖⵔⵎⴰⵜⵉⵏ, ⵉⵜⵜⵓⴳⴰⵏ ⵏⵉⵍ, ⴷ ⵓⵎⵚⵕⵉⵢ, ⴷ ⵡⴰⵎⵎⴰⵙ."
"A variation of the spire was the flèche, a slender, spear-like spire, which was usually placed on the transept where it crossed the nave.","ⵉⵍⵍⴰ ⵉⵎⵉⴽ ⵏ ⵓⵎⵢⴰⵍⵍⴰ ⴳ ⵜⵖⵔⵎⵜ ⵏ ⵜⵡⵙⵔⵎⵜ, ⴰⵛⴽⵓ ⵜⴳⴰ ⵜⵡⵙⵔⵎⵜ ⵉⴷⵓⵙⵏ, ⴰⵔ ⵜⵜⵓⴳⴰⵔ ⵅⴼ ⵢⵉⴼⵔ ⵜⴱⴱⵢ ⴰⵖⵣⵣⴰⵍ."

"Between 1964 and 1968, the entire site was carefully cut into large blocks (up to 30 tons, averaging 20 tons), dismantled, lifted and reassembled in a new location 65 metres higher and 200 metres back from the river, in one of the greatest challenges of archaeological engineering in history.","ⵉⵏⴳⵔ ⵓⵙⴳⴳⵯⴰⵙ ⵏ 1964 ⴷ 1968, ⵉⵜⵜⵢⴰⴱⴱⵢ ⵡⴰⵏⵙⴰ ⵅⴼ ⵉⴱⵟⵟⵓⵜⵏ ⵉⵅⴰⵜⴰⵔⵏ ⴽⵓⵍⵍⵓⵜ (ⴰⵔ 30 ⵟⵓⵏ, ⵙ ⵓⵏⴰⵎⵎⴰⵙ ⵏ 20ⵟⵓⵏ), ⵜⵜⵢⵉⵙⵢⵏ ⵉⵜⵜⵢⴰⵍⵙ ⵓⵙⵎⵓⵜⵜⵔ ⵏⵏⵙⵏ ⵖⵔ ⵡⴰⵏⵙⴰ ⴰⵎⴰⵢⵏⵓ ⴳ ⵜⴰⵜⵜⴰⵢⵜ ⵏ 65 ⵎⵉⵜⵔ ⴷ 200 ⵎⵉⵜⵔ ⵙⴳ ⵡⴰⵙⵉⴼ, ⵉⵏⵉⵍⵏ ⵏ ⵜⵎⵙⴷⴰⴳⵜ ⵏ ⵓⴹⵕⵉⵥ ⴳ ⵓⵎⵣⵔⵓⵢ."

"The Aswan Dam, or more specifically since the 1960s, the Aswan High Dam, is the world's largest embankment dam, which was built across the Nile in Aswan, Egypt, between 1960 and 1970.","ⵓⴳⴳⵓⴳ ⴰⵙⵡⴰⵏ, ⵏⵖ ⴷ ⵙ ⵜⵡⴰⵍⴰ ⵜⴰⵎⵥⵍⴰⵢⵜ ⵙⴳ ⵉⵙⴳⴳⵯⴰⵙⵏ 1960s, ⵓⴳⴳⵓⴳ ⴰⵙⵡⴰⵏ ⵢⴰⵜⵜⵓⵢⵏ, ⵉⴳⴰ ⵓⴳⴳⵓⴳ ⴰⴷ ⴰⵅⴰⵜⴰⵔ ⴳ ⵓⵎⴰⴹⴰⵍ, ⵉⵜⵜⵓⵙⴽⴰ ⵅⴼ ⵏⵏⵉⵍ ⴳ ⵓⵙⵡⴰⵏ, ⵎⵉⵚⵕ, ⴳⵔ ⵉⵙⴳⴳⵯⴰⵙⵏ 1960 ⴷ 1970."

Soil salinity also increased because the distance between the surface and the groundwater table was small enough (1–2 m depending on soil conditions and temperature) to allow water to be pulled up by evaporation so that the relatively small concentrations of salt in the groundwater accumulated on the soil surface over the years.,"ⵜⵎⵖⵓⵔ ⵜⵉⵎⵉⵔⵖⵜ ⵏ ⵡⴰⴽⴰⵍ ⴰⵍⵜⵓ ⴰⵛⴽⵓ ⵉⵎⵥⵥⵉⵢ ⵓⵙⵜⵓⵎ ⵏ ⴳⵔ ⵡⵓⴷⵎⴽⴰⵍ ⴷ ⵡⵓⴼⵓⵖ ⵏ ⵡⴰⵎⴰⵏ ⵏ ⴷⴷⴰⵡ ⵡⴰⴽⴰⵍ, (1-2 ⵎⵉⵜⵔ ⵙ ⵡⴰⵏⴰⵡ ⵏ ⵡⴰⴽⴰⵍ ⴷ ⵜⵙⴽⵯⴼⵍⵜ ⵏ ⵓⵏⵔⵖⵉ) ⵉ ⵡⴰⴷ ⵉⵜⵜⵢⵉⵊⵊ ⵉ ⵓⵙⵓⴼⵖ ⵏ ⵡⴰⵎⴰⵏ ⵙ ⵉⵔⵓⴳⴳⴰ ⴰⵛⴽⵓ ⵜⴳⴳⵓⴷⵉ ⵜⴰⵡⵏⴰ ⵏ ⵜⵉⵙⵏⵜ ⴳ ⵡⴰⵎⴰⵏ ⵏ ⴷⴷⴰⵡ ⵡⴰⴽⴰⵍ ⵅⴼ ⵡⵓⴷⵎⴽⴰⵍ ⵉⵙⴳⴳⵯⴰⵙⵏ ⵅⴼ ⵉⵙⴳⴳⵯⴰⵙⵏ."

This means that the dead storage volume would be filled up after 300–500 years if the sediment accumulated at the same rate throughout the area of the lake.,ⴰⵢⴰ ⴰⵢ ⵔⴰⴷ ⴷ ⵢⴰⵡⵢ ⴰⴽⵜⵓⵔ ⵏ ⵓⴽⵙⴰⵢ ⵏ ⵓⵖⵣⴰⵏ ⴼⴼⵉⵔ ⵏ 300-500 ⵏ ⵓⵙⴳⴳⵯⴰⵙ ⵎⴽ ⴷⴰ ⵜⵜⵎⵓⵜⵜⵓⵔⵏ ⵉⵙⵍⴰⵖⵏ ⵙ ⵉⵎⴽⵉ ⴳ ⵡⴰⵏⵙⵉⵡⵏ ⵎⴰⵕⵕⴰ ⵏ ⵜⵎⵏⴰⴹⵜ ⵏ ⵓⴳⵍⵎⴰⵎ.

"Indeed, physicalism, or the idea that matter is the only fundamental substance of reality, is explicitly rejected by Buddhism.","ⴳ ⵜⵉⵍⴰⵡⵜ, ⵜⴰⴳⵎⴰⵎⵜ, ⵏⵖ ⵜⵉⴽⵜⵉ ⵏ ⵉⵙ ⴷ ⵜⴰⴳⵎⴰⵎⵜ ⴰⵢⴷ ⵉⴳⴰⵏ ⵎⵓⵎⵎⵉ ⴰⴷⵙⵍⴰⵏ ⴰⴱⴰⵢⵍⴰⵍ ⵏ ⵜⵉⵍⴰⵡⵜ, ⵜⵓⴳⵢ ⵜⵜ ⵜⴱⵓⴷⵉⵜ."
"While the former commonly have mass, location, velocity, shape, size, and numerous other physical attributes, these are not generally characteristic of mental phenomena.","ⴳ ⵓⴷⵖⴰⵔ, ⵜⵍⵍⴰ ⵖⵓⵔ ⵜⵎⵣⵡⴰⵔⵓⵜ ⵜⴰⵙⵜⵍⵉ ⴷ ⵡⴰⵏⵙⴰ ⴷ ⵓⵙⴷⴷⵔⴼ ⴷ ⵜⴰⵍⵖⴰ ⴷ ⵓⴽⵙⴰⵢ ⴷ ⴽⵉⴳⴰⵏ ⵏ ⵜⵎⵉⵜⴰⵔ ⵏ ⵜⴼⴳⴳⴰ ⵢⴰⴹⵏ, ⵜⵉⴷ ⵓⵔ ⴳⵉⵏⵜ ⵙⴳ ⵜⵎⵉⵜⴰⵔ ⵏ ⵜⵓⵎⴰⵏⵉⵏ ⵜⵉⵏⴰⵍⵍⴰⵖⵉⵏ ⵙ ⵜⴰⵍⵖⴰ ⵜⴰⵎⴰⵜⵓⵜ."

"Physicalistic monism asserts that the only existing substance is physical, in some sense of that term to be clarified by our best science.","ⴰⵔ ⵜⵙⴷⴷⵉ ⵜⵎⵢⵓⵡⵜ ⵜⴰⴼⵉⵣⵉⵇⵜ ⵉⵙ ⵓⵔ ⵉⵍⵍⵉ ⴳ ⵜⴳⵎⴰⵎⵉⵏ ⵉⵍⵍⴰⵏ ⴱⵍⴰ ⵜⴰⴼⵉⵣⵉⵇⵜ, ⵙ ⵓⵏⴰⵎⴽ ⵏ ⵉⵙ ⴷⴰ ⵉⵜⵜⵓⵙⵉⴽⵉⵣ ⵢⵉⵔⵎ ⴰⴷ ⵙ ⵓⵎⵢⵉⴼ ⵏ ⵜⵓⵙⵙⵏⴰ ⵉⵍⵍⴰⵏ."
"Although pure idealism, such as that of George Berkeley, is uncommon in contemporary Western philosophy, a more sophisticated variant called panpsychism, according to which mental experience and properties may be at the foundation of physical experience and properties, has been espoused by some philosophers such as Alfred North Whitehead and David Ray Griffin.","ⵡⴰⵅⵅⴰ ⵓⵔ ⵜⵜⵢⴰⵙⵙⵏ ⵜⵎⵢⴰⵏⵜ ⵜⴰⴱⴰⵢⵍⴰⵍⵜ, ⵣⵓⵏ ⴷ ⵜⵉⵏ ⵊⵓⵔⵊ ⴱⵉⵔⴽⵍⵉ ⴳ ⵜⴼⵍⵙⴰⴼⵜ ⵏ ⵓⵖⵍⵍⵓⵢ ⵜⴰⵜⵔⴰⵜ, ⵎⴰⴽⴰ ⵉⵍⵍⴰ ⵢⴰⵏ ⵓⵙⵏⴼⵍ ⵉⵜⵜⵢⴰⵙⵙⵏⵏ ⵙ ⵜⴰⴱⴰⵏⴱⵙⵉⴽⵉⵜ (panpsychism), ⵉⵖⵉⵏ ⵉⵙ ⵜⴳⴰ ⵜⴰⵙⵉⵍⴰ ⵏ ⵜⵉⵔⵎⵜ ⴷ ⵜⵎⵉⵜⴰⵔ ⵏ ⵜⴼⵉⵣⵉⵇⵜ, ⵓⵙⵉⵏ ⵜⵜ ⴽⵔⴰ ⵏ ⵉⴼⵍⵙⴰⴼⵏ ⵣⵓⵏ ⴷ ⴰⵍⴱⵉⵔⵜ ⵏⵓⵔⵜ ⵡⴰⵢⵜⵉⵀⵉⴷ ⴷ ⴷⵉⴰⵢⴼⵉⴷ ⵔⴰⵢ ⴳⵔⵉⴼⵉⵏ."
A third possibility is to accept the existence of a basic substance that is neither physical nor mental.,ⵜⵉⵖⵉⵜ ⵜⵉⵙ ⴽⵕⴰⴹⵜ ⵜⴳⴰ ⴰⵎⵙⴰⵙⴰ ⵏ ⵢⵉⵍⵉ ⵏ ⵜⴳⵎⴰⵎⵜ ⵜⴰⴰⴷⵙⵍⴰⵏⵜ ⵓⵔ ⵉⴳⵉⵏ ⵜⵉⵏ ⵜⴼⴳⴳⴰ ⵓⵍⴰ ⵜⵉⵏ ⵡⴰⵍⵍⴰⵖ.

"Parallel to these developments in psychology, a philosophical behaviorism (sometimes called logical behaviorism) was developed.","ⵙ ⵜⴰⵎⵓⵏⵜ ⴷ ⵉⴱⵓⵖⵍⵓⵜⵏ ⴰⴷ ⴳ ⵜⴱⵙⵉⴽⵓⵍⵓⵊⵜ, ⵜⴻⵜⵜⵓⴳⴰ ⵜⵉⴳⵎⵉ ⵉ ⵜⵉⴽⵍⵉ ⵜⴰⴼⵍⵙⴰⴼⵜ (ⵉⵍⴰⵏ ⴰⵙⵙⴰⵖ ⵏ ⵜⵉⴽⵍⵉ ⵜⵓⵏⴳⵉⵏⵜ)."
"These philosophers reasoned that, if mental states are something material, but not behavioral, then mental states are probably identical to internal states of the brain.","ⵙⵢⴼⴰⵏ ⵉⴼⵍⵙⵓⴼⵏ ⴰⴷ ⵙ ⵉⴳ ⴳⴰⵏ ⵡⴰⴷⴷⴰⴷⵏ ⵉⵏⴰⵍⵍⴰⵖⵏ ⴰⴳⵎⴰⵎ, ⵎⴰⵛⴰ ⵓⵔ ⴷ ⵜⵓⵏⴳⵉⵏⵜ, ⵉⵖⵢ ⴰⴷ ⴳⵉⵏ ⴰⴷⴷⴰⴷⵏ ⵉⵏⴰⵍⵍⴰⵖⵏ ⵉⵎⵓⵏⵏ ⴷ ⵡⴰⴷⴷⴰⴷⵏ ⵉⴳⵏⵙⴰⵏⵏ ⵏ ⵓⵏⵍⵉ."
"According to token identity theories, the fact that a certain brain state is connected with only one mental state of a person does not have to mean that there is an absolute correlation between types of mental state and types of brain state.","ⵙ ⵜⵉⵥⵉⵕⵉⵏ ⵏ ⵜⴰⵎⵓⵙⵜ ⵜⴰⵣⵎⵓⵍⴰⵏⵜ, ⵜⴳⴰ ⵜⵉⴷⵜ ⵏ ⵡⴰⴷⴷⴰⴷ ⴰⵏⴰⵍⵍⴰⵖ ⵜⴰⵎⵣⴷⴰⵢⵜ ⵙ ⵡⴰⴷⴷⴰⴷ ⴰⵏⴰⵍⵍⴰⵖ ⵏ ⵢⴰⵏ ⵓⴼⴳⴰⵏ, ⵓⵔ ⵉⴳⵉⵏ ⴰⵏⴳⵉⴷⴷⴰ ⴷ ⵜⵉⵍⴰⵡⵜ ⵏ ⴳⵔ ⵡⴰⵏⴰⵡⵏ ⵏ ⵡⴰⴷⴷⴰⴷ ⴰⵏⴰⵍⵍⴰⵖ ⴷ ⵡⴰⵏⴰⵡⵏ ⵏ ⵡⴰⴷⴷⴰⴷ ⵏ ⵉⵏⵍⵉ."
"Finally, Wittgenstein's idea of meaning as use led to a version of functionalism as a theory of meaning, further developed by Wilfrid Sellars and Gilbert Harman.","ⴳ ⵜⴳⵉⵔⴰ, ⵜⵓⵡⵉ ⴷ ⵜⴽⵜⵉ ⵏ ⴼⵉⵜⵊⵏⵛⵜⴰⵢⵏ ⵅⴼ ⵓⵏⴰⵎⴽ ⵉⴳⴰⵏ ⴰⵙⵡⵓⵔⵉ ⵏ ⵜⵓⵏⵖⵉⵍⵜ ⵙⴳ ⵜⴰⵣⵣⵓⵍⵜ ⵏ ⵜⵉⵥⵉⵕⵜ ⵏ ⵓⵏⴰⵎⴽ, ⵉⵙⵙⴳⵎⴰ ⵡⵉⵍⴼⵔⵉⴷ ⵙⵉⵍⴰⵔⵣ ⴷ ⵊⵉⵍⴱⵔⵜ ⵀⴰⵔⵎⴰⵏ."
"Hence, the question arises whether there can still be a non-reductive physicalism.","ⴷⴷⵉⵔ ⴰⵙ, ⵉⴳⴰ ⵓⵙⵇⵙⵉ ⵢⴰⴽⴽⴰⵏ ⵉⵅⴼ ⵏⵏⵙ, ⵉⵙ ⵉⵙⵓⵍ ⵉⵍⵍⴰ ⴰⵏⴷⴷⵓ ⴰⴼⵉⵣⵉⵇⵉ ⵓⵔ ⵉⵜⵜⵓⵙⴳⵣⵍⵏ."

"The flame displays a type of continuity in that the candle does not go out while it is burning, but there is not really any identity of the flame from one moment to another over time.","ⴷⴰ ⵉⵙⵙⴽⴰⵏ ⵓⴱⵍⴰⵍⴰⵖ ⵢⴰⵏ ⵡⴰⵏⴰⵡ ⵏ ⵜⴰⴷⵓⵎⵜ ⴳ ⵢⵉⵖ ⵏ ⵜⴱⵓⵔⴱⵓⵜ ⴷ ⵡⵓⵖⵓⵙ ⵏⵏⵙ, ⵎⴰⵛⴰ ⵓⵔ ⵜⵍⵍⵉ ⴰⵡⴷ ⵢⴰⵜ ⵜⴰⵎⵓⵙⵜ ⵖⵓⵔ ⵓⴱⵍⴰⵍⴰⵖ ⴳ ⵢⴰⵜ ⵜⵉⵣⵉ ⵖⵔ ⵜⴰⵢⴹ ⵅⴼ ⵜⵡⴰⴷⴰ ⵏ ⵡⴰⴽⵓⴷ."

Some philosophers argue that this is because there is an underlying conceptual confusion.,ⵎⵔⴰⵔⴰⵏ ⴰⵡⴰⵍ ⴽⵔⴰ ⵏ ⵉⴼⵍⵙⴰⴼⵏ ⵅⴼ ⵓⵎⵏⵜⵉⵍ ⵏ ⵜⵉⵍⴰⵡⵜ ⵏ ⵓⵅⵡⵡⴹ ⵏ ⵉⵔⵎⵎⵓⵙⵏ ⵉⴷⵙⵍⴰⵏⵏ.
"Rather it should simply be accepted that human experience can be described in different ways—for instance, in a mental and in a biological vocabulary.","ⴳ ⵓⴷⵖⴰⵔ ⵏⵏⵙ, ⵉⵍⴰⵇ ⵓⵎⵙⴰⵙⴰ ⴷ ⵜⵉⵔⵎⵉⵜ ⵜⴰⵏⴼⴳⴰⵏⵜ ⵎⵉ ⵏⵖⵢ ⴰⴷ ⵏⴼⴽ ⵜⵉⵎⵉⵜⴰⵔ ⵏ ⵉⴱⵔⴷⴰⵏ ⵉⴱⴹⴰⵏ - ⵅⴼ ⵓⵎⴷⵢⴰ, ⴳ ⵜⴳⵓⵔⵉⵡⵉⵏ ⵜⵉⵏⴰⵍⵍⴰⵖⵉⵏ ⴷ ⵜⴱⵢⵓⵍⵓⵊⵉⵜⵉⵏ."
The brain is simply the wrong context for the use of mental vocabulary—the search for mental states of the brain is therefore a category error or a sort of fallacy of reasoning.,ⵉⴳⴰ ⵓⵏⵍⵉ ⵢⴰⵏ ⵡⴰⵏⵙⴰ ⵉⵣⴳⵍⵏ ⵏ ⵓⵙⵡⵓⵔⵉ ⵏ ⵜⴳⵓⵔⵉⵡⵉⵏ ⵜⵉⵏⴰⵍⵍⴰⵖⵉⵏ - ⴳ ⵜⴳⵉⵔⴰ ⵉⴳⴰ ⵓⵔⵣⵣⵓ ⵅⴼ ⵡⴰⴷⴷⴰⴷⵏ ⵉⵏⴰⵍⵍⴰⵖⵏ ⵏ ⵓⵏⵍⵉ ⴰⵣⴳⴳⴰⵍ ⴳ ⴱⵟⵟⵓ ⵏⵖ ⴰⵏⴰⵡ ⵏ ⵉⵣⴳⴳⴰⵍⵏ ⴳ ⵓⵙⵡⵏⴳⵎ.
"And it is characteristic of a mental state that it has some experiential quality, e.g. of pain, that it hurts.","ⵙⴳ ⵜⵎⵉⵜⴰⵔ ⵏ ⵡⴰⴷⴷⴰⴷ ⴰⵏⴰⵍⵍⴰⵖ ⵉⵙ ⵖⵓⵔⵙ ⵜⴰⵎⴰⵜⴰⵔⵜ ⵜⴰⵏⵉⵔⵉⵎⵜ, ⵅⴼ ⵓⵎⴷⵢⴰ ⵉ ⵢⵉⵖⵉⵇ, ⴷⴰ ⵜⵙⵙⵉⵖⵉⵇ."

"The 20th-century German philosopher Martin Heidegger criticized the ontological assumptions underpinning such a reductive model, and claimed that it was impossible to make sense of experience in these terms.","ⵉⴼⴽⴰ ⵓⴼⵍⵙⴰⴼ ⴰⵍⵎⴰⵏⵉ ⵎⴰⵔⵜⵏ ⵀⴰⵢⴷⵉⴳⵔ ⴰⵣⵖⴰⵏ ⵏⵏⵙ ⴳ ⵜⵙⵓⵜⴰ ⵜⵉⵙ 20 ⵅⴼ ⵜⵓⵔⴷⴰⵡⵉⵏ ⵜⵓⵏⵟⵓⵍⵓⵊⵉⵜⵉⵏ ⵅⴼ ⵉⵙⴽⴰ ⵓⵎⴷⵢⴰ ⴰⴷ ⵏ ⵓⵣⴳⵣⵍ, ⵉⵏⵏⴰ ⵉⵙ ⵓⵔ ⵉⵜⵜⵓⵣⵎⵉⵔ ⵓⵔⵎⴰⵙ ⵏ ⵜⵉⵔⵎⵉⵜ ⴳ ⵢⵉⵔⵎⴰⵡⵏ ⴰⴷ."
This problem of explaining introspective first-person aspects of mental states and consciousness in general in terms of third-person quantitative neuroscience is called the explanatory gap.,ⵜⴰⵎⵓⴽⵔⵉⵙⵜ ⴰⴷ ⵜⵍⴰ ⴰⵙⴼⵙⵔ ⴳ ⵜⵙⴳⴳⵯⵉⵏ ⵜⵉⵏⵉⵍⵎⵉⵏ ⵉ ⵡⴰⴷⴷⴰⴷⵏ ⵉⵏⴰⵍⵍⴰⵖⵏ ⴷ ⵢⵉⴽⵢ ⵙ ⵜⴰⵍⵖⴰ ⵜⴰⵎⴰⵜⵓⵜ ⵙⴳ ⵓⵙⴽⵙⵡ ⵏ ⵜⵓⵙⵙⵏⴰ ⵏ ⵉⵥⵕⴰⵏ ⵜⴰⵎⵙⵖⴰⵍⵜ ⵉ ⵓⵡⴷⴰⵏⵡⵉⵙ ⴽⵕⴰⴹ ⵜⵍⴰ ⴰⵙⵙⴰⵖ ⵏ ⵜⵅⴱⵓⵜ ⵜⴰⵙⴼⵙⴰⵔⵜ.

Several factors contributed to the birth of pre-Socratic philosophy in Ancient Greece.,ⵉⴱⵣⵔ ⴽⵉⴳⴰⵏ ⵏ ⵜⵎⵏⵜⵉⵍⵉⵏ ⵏ ⵜⵍⴰⵍⵉⵜ ⵏ ⵜⴼⵍⵙⴰⴼⵜ ⵏ ⴷⴰⵜ ⵏ ⵙⵓⵇⵕⴰⵟ ⴳ ⵍⵢⵓⵏⴰⵏ ⴰⵣⴰⵢⴽⵓ.
"Another factor was the ease and frequency of intra-Greek travel, which led to the blending and comparison of ideas.","ⵙⴳ ⵜⵎⵏⵜⵉⵍⵉⵏ ⵢⴰⴹⵏ ⴰⵡⵀⴰⵏ ⴷ ⵓⵣⴷⴰⵢ ⵏ ⵓⵎⵓⴷⴷⵓ ⴰⵎⵎⴰⵙ ⵏ ⵍⵢⵓⵏⴰⵏ, ⵏⵏⴰ ⵢⵓⴷⵊⴰⵏ ⵜⵓⵙⵙⵓⵔⵜ ⵏ ⵜⵡⵏⴳⵉⵎⵉⵏ ⴷ ⵓⵙⵏⵓⵃⵢⵓ ⵏⵏⵙⵏ."
The democratic political system of independent poleis also contributed to the rise of philosophy.,ⵎⴽⵉⵏⵏⴰ ⵢⵉⵡⵙ ⵓⵎⴰⴳⴰⵡ ⴰⵙⵔⵜⴰⵏ ⴰⴷⵉⵎⵓⵇⵕⴰⵜⵉⵢ ⵉ ⵓⵎⴰⴳⴰⵡ ⵉⵏⵏⴱⴹⵏ ⵏ ⵢⵉⵎⴰⵍ ⴳ ⵜⴳⵎⵉ ⵏ ⵜⴼⵍⵙⴰⴼⵜ.
"The philosophers' ideas, were, to a certain extent, answers to questions that were subtly present in the work of Homer and Hesiod.","ⴳⴰⵏⵜ ⵜⵡⵏⴳⵉⵎⵉⵏ ⵏ ⵉⴼⴰⵢⵍⴰⵙⵓⴼⵏ, ⵢⴰⵏ ⵉⵎⵉⴽ, ⵜⵉⵎⵔⴰⵔⵓⵜⵉⵏ ⵅⴼ ⵉⵙⵇⵙⵉⵜⵏ ⵏⵏⴰ ⵉⵜⵜⵓⵙⴽⴰⵔⵏ ⵙ ⵢⴰⵜ ⵜⵎⴰⵎⴽ ⵉⵛⵡⴰⵏ ⴳ ⵜⵡⵓⵔⵉ ⵏ ⵀⵓⵎⵔ ⴷ ⵀⵉⵙⵓⴷ."

"The first pre-Socratic philosophers also traveled extensively to other lands, meaning that pre-Socratic thought had roots abroad as well as domestically.","ⵙⴳ ⵉⴼⴰⵢⵍⴰⵙⵓⴼⵏ ⵉⵎⵣⵡⵓⵔⴰ ⵏⵏⴰ ⵉⵎⵎⵓⴷⴷⴰⵏ ⴷⴰⵜ ⵏ ⵙⵓⵇⵕⴰⵟ ⵙ ⵢⴰⵏ ⵓⴷⵖⴰⵔ ⴱⵀⵔⴰ ⵉⵎⵇⵇⵓⵔⵏ ⵙ ⵉⴽⴰⵍⵏ ⵏⵏⵉⴹⵏ, ⵏⵏⴰ ⵉⵎⵎⴰⵍⴰⵏ ⵎⴰⵙⴷ ⴰⵡⵏⴳⵎ ⴷⴰⵜ ⵏ ⵙⵓⵇⵕⴰⵜ ⵍⵍⴰⵏ ⴰⵙ ⵉⵥⵕⴰⵏ ⴳ ⴱⵕⵕⴰ ⵓⵍⴰ ⴳ ⵓⵙⵡⵉⵔ ⴰⵎⵓⵔⴰⵏ."
The pre-Socratic philosophers shared the intuition that there was a single explanation that could explain both the plurality and the singularity of the whole – and that explanation would not be direct actions of the gods.,ⴰⵎⵓⵏ ⵉⴼⴰⵢⵍⴰⵙⵓⴼⵏ ⵏ ⴷⴰⵜ ⵙⵓⵇⵕⴰⵟ ⵜⴰⵡⵏⴳⵉⵎⵜ ⵎⴰⵙⴷ ⵉⵍⵍⴰ ⵢⴰⵏ ⵓⵙⵙⴼⵙⵔ ⵏⵏⴰ ⵉⵣⵎⵔⵏ ⴰⴷ ⵉⵙⵙⴼⵔⵓ ⵜⴰⵎⴰⵏⴰⵡⵜ ⴷ ⵜⵎⴷⴰⵏⵜ ⵏ ⵎⴰⵕⵕⴰ- ⴷ ⵓⵙⵙⴼⵔⵓ ⴰⴷ ⵓⵔ ⵉⵏⵏⵉ ⴰⴷ ⵉⴳ ⵉⴳⴳⵉⵜⵏ ⵓⵙⵔⵉⴷⵏ ⴷⴰⵔ ⵉⴷ ⵡⴰⴽⵓⵛⵏ.
"Many sought the material principle (arche) of things, and the method of their origin and disappearance.","ⵡⵜⵏ ⴽⵉⴳⴰⵏ ⴳⵉⵙⵏ ⴰⴷ ⵙⵏⵙⵉⵏ ⵏ ⵓⵎⵏⵣⴰⵢ ⵏ ⵜⵖⴰⵡⵙⵉⵡⵉⵏ, ⴷ ⵜⵎⴰⵎⴽⵜ ⵏⵏⴰ ⴳ ⵜⵜⵓⴳⴰ ⴷ ⵓⵍⴰⵃ ⵏⵏⵙ."
"In their effort to make sense of the cosmos they coined new terms and concepts such as rhythm, symmetry, analogy, deductionism, reductionism, mathematicazion of nature and others.","ⴳ ⵜⵎⵙⵙⵓⵎⴰⵏⵜ ⵏⵏⵙ ⴰⴷ ⵔⵎⵙⵏ ⴰⵎⵖⵔⴰⴷ ⵃⵢⵢⵍⵏ ⵉⵔⵉⵎⵏ ⴷ ⵉⵔⵎⵎⵓⵙⵏ ⵉⵎⴰⵢⵏⵓⵜⵏ ⵣⵓⵏⴷ ⴰⵏⵢⴰ, ⴷ ⵓⵎⵜⵔⴰ, ⴷ ⵡⵓⴽⵓⵙ, ⴷ ⵓⵣⴳⵣⵍ, ⴷ ⵜⵓⵙⵏⴰⴽⵜ ⵜⴰⴳⴰⵎⴰⵏⵜ ⴷ ⵡⵉⵢⵢⴰⴹ."

"This may have been because of a lack of instruments, or because of a tendency to view the world as a unity, undeconstructable, so it would be impossible for an external eye to observe tiny fractions of nature under experimental control.","ⵄⵏⵉⵖ ⵉⵍⵍⴰ ⵓⵢⵏⵏⴰⵖ ⵙ ⵜⵎⵏⵜⵉⵍⵜ ⵏ ⵜⴷⵔⵙⵉ ⵏ ⵉⵎⴰⵙⵙⵏ, ⵏⵖ ⵙ ⵜⵎⵏⵜⵉⵍⵜ ⵏ ⵓⴼⵔⵔⵓⵖ ⵙ ⵜⵙⴳⴰ ⵏ ⵜⴰⵏⵏⴰⵢⵜ ⵏ ⵓⵎⴰⴹⴰⵍ ⵎⴰⵙ ⵉⴳⴰ ⵢⴰⵏ ⵓⴼⵔⴷⵉⵙ ⵓⵔ ⵉⵍⴰⵇⵏ ⵉ ⵓⵙⵎⵓⵏ, ⵎⴰⵏ ⴰⵢⴰ ⵇⴰⴷ ⴰⵙ ⵢⵓⴳⵓⵎ ⵉ ⵜⵉⵟⵟ ⵏ ⴱⵕⵕⴰ ⴰⴷ ⵜⵥⵕ ⵉⴳⵣⵣⵓⵎⵏ ⵉⵎⵥⵥⴰⵏⵏ ⴳ ⵓⴳⴰⵎⴰ ⴷⴷⴰⵡ ⵏ ⵡⵓⵟⵓⴼ ⵏ ⵜⵏⴰⵔⴰⵎⵜ."

"The pre-Socratics were not atheists; however, they minimized the extent of the gods' involvement in natural phenomena such as thunder or totally eliminated the gods from the natural world.","ⴰⵢⵏⵏⴰ ⵉⵥⵍⵉⵏ ⵙ ⴷⴰⵜ ⵏ ⵉⵙⵓⵇⵕⴰⵟⵉⵢⵏ ⵓⵔ ⴳⵉⵏ ⴰⴽⴽⵯ ⵉⴽⴰⴼⵔⵏ, ⵅⵙ ⵜⴷⴷⴰ ⴰⵍⵍⵉⴳ ⵜⴷⵔⵓⵙ ⵜⵍⴽⵎ ⵏⵏ ⵢⴰⵏ ⵓⵙⵡⵉⵔ ⴳ ⴷⵔⴰⵏ ⵉⴽⵓⵛⵏ ⴳ ⵜⵓⵎⴰⵏⵉⵏ ⵜⵉⴳⴰⵎⴰⵏⵉⵏ ⵣⵓⵏⴷ ⴰⴳⴳⵉⵏ ⵏⵖ ⵜⴽⴽⵙ ⵉⴽⵓⵛⵏ ⵇⵇⴰⵃ ⵙⴳ ⵓⵎⴰⴹⴰⵍ ⴰⴳⴰⵎⴰⵏ."
"The first phase of pre-Socratic philosophy, mainly the Milesians, Xenophanes, and Heraclitus, consisted of rejecting traditional cosmogony and attempting to explain nature based on empirical observations and interpretations.","ⵜⵉⴼⵔⴽⵜ ⵜⴰⵎⵣⵡⴰⵔⵓⵜ ⴳ ⵜⴼⵍⵙⴰⴼⵜ ⵏ ⴷⴰⵜ ⵙⵓⵇⵕⴰⵟ, ⵙⵍⴰⵡⴰⵏ ⴰⴽⴽⵯ ⵍⵎⵉⵍⵉⵙⵉⵢⵢⵉⵏ, ⵣⵉⵏⵓⴼⴰⵏⵙ, ⴷ ⵀⵉⵔⴰⴽⵍⵉⵜⵓⵙ, ⴷⴰ ⵜⵜⵓⵚⵚⴽⴰ ⵙⴳ ⵡⴰⴳⵉ ⴰⵖⵣⵓⵔⴰⵏ ⴰⵣⴰⵢⴽⵓ ⴷ ⵢⵉⵔⵉⵎ ⵏ ⵓⵙⵙⴼⵔⵓ ⵏ ⵓⴳⴰⵎⴰ ⵅⴼ ⵓⵢⵏⵏⴰ ⴳⴰⵏ ⵜⴰⵏⵏⴰⵢⵉⵏ ⴷ ⵉⵙⵙⴼⵔⵓⵜⵏ ⵉⵏⴰⵔⴰⵎⵏ."

Thales may have been of Phoenician ancestry.,ⵄⵏⵉⵖ ⵉⴳⴰ ⵟⴰⵍⵉⵙ ⵙⴳ ⵜⴷⴼⵔⵜ ⵏ ⴼⵉⵏⵉⵙⵜⵔⵉ.
"Thales, though, advanced geometry with his abstract deductive reasoning reaching universal generalizations.","ⵜⴰⵍⵉⵙ, ⵎⵇⵇⴰⵔ ⵜⵍⵍⴰ ⵜⴰⵏⵣⴳⵉⵜ ⵜⴰⵜⵔⴰⵔⵜ ⴰⴽⴷ ⵜⵓⵏⴳⵉⵏⵜ ⵏ ⵓⵙⴼⵍⵓ ⵏⵏⵙ ⴰⵎⵥⵍⴰⵢ ⴰⴷ ⵉⵍⴽⵎ ⴰⵙⵎⴰⵜⴰ ⴰⵎⴰⴹⵍⴰⵏ."
"Thales visited Sardis, as many Greeks then, where astronomical records were kept and used astronomical observations for practical matters (oil harvesting).","ⵉⵔⵣⴼ ⵟⴰⵍⵉⵙ ⵉⵖⵔⵎ ⵏ ⵙⴰⵔⴷⵉⵙ, ⵎⴽⵉⵏⵏⴰ ⵉⵔⵣⴼ ⴽⵉⴳⴰⵏ ⵏ ⵉⵢⵓⵏⴰⵢⵉⵢⵏ ⴳ ⵜⵉⵣⵉ ⵏⵏⴰⵖ, ⴰⵛⴽⵓ ⵉⵃⴹⴰ ⴰⵔⵔⴰⵜⵏ ⵉⵡⵏⴳⵉⵎⵏ ⵉⵙⵙⵎⵔⵙ ⵜⴰⵏⵏⴰⵢⵉⵏ ⵜⵉⵡⵏⴳⵉⵎⵉⵏ ⴳ ⵜⵖⴰⵡⵙⵉⵡⵉⵏ ⵜⵉⵎⴰⵙⵙⴰⵏⵉⵏ (ⴰⵙⵎⵓⵏ ⵏ ⵓⴼⵉⵜⵔⵓⵍ)."
He attributed the origin of the world to an element instead of a divine being.,ⵉⴷⵡⵍ ⵓⵥⵓⵚ ⵏ ⵓⵎⴰⴹⴰⵍ ⵙ ⵢⴰⵏ ⵓⴼⵔⴷⵉⵙ ⴳ ⵡⴰⵏⵙⴰ ⵏ ⵓⵎⵖⵏⴰⵡ ⴰⴽⵓⵛⴰⵏ.
"He was a member of the elite of Miletus, wealthy and a statesman.","ⵉⴳⴰ ⵢⴰⵏ ⵓⵎⵙⵍⴰⵢ ⴳ ⵜⴷⵖⴰⵔⵜ ⵏ ⵎⵉⵍⵉⵜⵓⵙ, ⵍⵍⵉ ⴳ ⵍⵍⴰⵏ ⵉⴱⴰⵖⵓⵔⵏ ⴷ ⵉⵔⴳⴰⵣⵏ ⵏ ⵡⵓⵏⴽⵜ."
"In response to Thales, he postulated as the first principle an undefined, unlimited substance without qualities (apeiron), out of which the primary opposites, hot and cold, moist and dry, became differentiated.","ⴳ ⵜⵎⵔⴰⵔⵓⵜ ⵅⴼ ⵟⴰⵍⵉⵙ, ⵉⵖⴰⵍ ⵎⴰⵙⴷ ⴰⵙⵙⵏⵜⵉ ⴰⵎⵣⵡⴰⵔⵓ ⵉⴳⴰ ⵢⴰⵜ ⵜⵎⵜⵜⴰ ⵓⵔ ⵉⴳⵉⵏ ⵜⴰⵎⵥⵍⴰⵢⵜ ⴷ ⵓⵔ ⵉⵍⵉⵏ ⴰⵡⵓⵜⵜⵓ ⴷ ⴱⵍⴰ ⵜⵉⴼⵔⴰⵙⵉⵏ, ⵍⵍⵉ ⴰⵙ ⵉⴳⴰⵏ ⵜⵓⵣⵍⵜ ⵜⴰⴳⵊⴷⴰⵏⵜ, ⵉⵔⵖⴰⵏ ⴷ ⵉⵇⵔⴼⵏ, ⵉⵍⴳⴳⵯⴰⵖⵏ ⵉⵣⵡⴰⵏ, ⵓⵔ ⵉⵍⵉⵏ ⴰⵏⴰⵡ."
He is also known for speculating on the origin of mankind.,ⵉⵜⵜⵡⴰⵙⵙⴰⵏ ⴰⵡⴷ ⵙ ⵓⵙⵡⵉⵏⴳⵎ ⵏⵏⵙ ⴳ ⵓⵥⵓⵕ ⵏ ⵜⴼⴳⴰⵏⵉⵜ.
He also wrote a book on nature in prose.,ⵢⴰⵔⴰ ⴰⵡⴷ ⵉⵜⵜⴰⵔⴰ ⵢⴰⵏ ⵓⴷⵍⵉⵙ ⵅⴼ ⵓⴳⴰⵎⴰ ⴳ ⵜⵔⵉⵡⴰⵏⵜ.
He was a well-traveled poet whose primary interests were theology and epistemology.,ⵉⴳⴰ ⵢⴰⵏ ⵓⵏⵎⴰⴷⴷⵓ ⵉⵖⵓⴷⴰⵏ ⴷ ⵜⵉⵡⵉⵜⵉⵏ ⵏⵏⵙ ⵜⵉⵅⴰⵜⴰⵔⵉⵏ ⴳⴰⵏⵜ ⵍⵍⴰⵀⵓⵜ ⴷ ⵜⵓⵙⵙⵏⴰⴷⵔⵉⵣⵏ.
"He famously said that if oxen, horses, or lions could draw, they would draw their gods as oxen, horses, or lions.","ⵉⵏⵏⴰ ⵓⵎⴰⵙⵙⴰⵏ ⵎⴰⵙ ⵎⴽ ⵍⵍⴰⵏ ⵉⵎⴰⵙⵙⵏ, ⵉⵢⵙⴰⵏ, ⵏⵖ ⵉⵣⵎⴰⵡⵏ ⵣⵎⵔⵏ ⴰⴷ ⵜⵜⵓⵙⵓⵏⵖⵏ, ⵀⴰⵜ ⵇⴰⴷ ⵜⵙⵙⵓⵖⵏⵜ ⵉⴷ ⵕⴱⴱⵉ ⵏⵏⵙⵏ ⵣⵓⵏⴷ ⵉⵎⴰⵙⵙⵏ, ⵉⵢⵙⴰⵏ, ⵏⵖ ⵉⵣⵎⴰⵡⵏ."
"Xenophanes also offered naturalistic explanations for phenomena such as the sun, the rainbow and St. Elmo's fire.",ⵎⴽⵉⵏⵏⴰ ⵉⵡⵛⴰ ⵣⵉⵏⵓⴼⴰⵏⵙ ⵉⵙⵙⴼⵔⵓⵜⵏ ⵏ ⵉⴳⴰⵎⴰⵏ ⵉ ⵜⵓⵎⴰⵏⵉⵏ ⵣⵓⵏⴷ ⵜⴰⴼⵓⴳⵜ ⴷ ⵜⵉⵙⵍⵉⵜ ⵏ ⵓⵏⵥⴰⵕ ⴷ ⵜⴰⴽⴰⵜⵉⵏ ⵏ ⵍⵎⵓⵙⴼⵉⵔ.
"While Xenophanes was a pessimist about the capability of humans to reach knowledge, he also believed in gradual progress through critical thinking.","ⵍⵍⵉⵖ ⴳ ⵉⵎⵇⵜ ⵣⵉⵏⵓⴼⴰⵏⵙ ⴰⵡⴰⵍ ⵅⴼ ⵜⵣⵎⵔⵜ ⵏ ⵓⴼⴳⴰⵏ ⴰⴷ ⵉⵍⴽⵎ ⵜⵓⵙⵙⵏⴰ, ⵉⵍⵍⴰ ⵉⴼⵓⵍⵙ ⴰⵡⴷ ⵙ ⵓⴼⴰⵔⴰ ⵉⵎⵉⴽ ⵙ ⵉⵎⵉⴽ ⵙ ⵓⵙⵡⵉⵏⴳⵎ ⴰⵏⴼⴰⵔⴰⵏ."
Heraclitus posited that all things in nature are in a state of perpetual flux.,ⵉⴷⵎⴰ ⵀⵉⵔⴰⴽⵍⵉⵜⵓⵙ ⵎⴰⵙⴷ ⵇⵇⴰⵃ ⵜⵉⵖⴰⵡⵙⵉⵡⵉⵏ ⴳ ⵓⴳⴰⵎⴰ ⵍⵍⴰⵏⵜ ⴳ ⵢⴰⵏ ⵡⴰⴷⴷⴰⴷ ⵏ ⵓⴱⵓⵖⵍⵍⵓ ⵏ ⵡⴰⴱⴷⴰ.
Fire becomes water and earth and vice versa.,ⴷⴰ ⵜⵜⴷⵡⴰⵍ ⵜⴰⴽⴰⵜ ⵜⴳⴰ ⴰⵎⴰⵏ ⴷ ⵡⴰⴽⴰⵍ ⵏⵖ ⴰⵙⵎⵍⴻⵍⵍⵉ ⵏⵏⵙ.
"There, Heraclitus claims we can not step into the same river twice, a position summarized with the slogan ta panta rhei (everything flows).","ⵖⵉⵏⵏⴰ ⴰⵙ ⵉⵜⵜⵉⵏⵉ ⵀⵉⵔⴰⴽⵍⵉⵜⵓⵙ ⵎⴰⵙⴷ ⵓⵔ ⵏⵣⵎⵉⵔ ⴰⴷ ⵏⴽⵛⵎ ⴳ ⵢⴰⵏ ⵡⴰⵙⵉⴼ ⵙⵏⴰⵜ ⵜⵉⴽⴽⴰⵍ, ⴷ ⵏⵜⵜⴰ ⴰⴷ ⵉⴳⴰⵏ ⴰⵙⴳⵣⵍ ⵏ ⵡⴰⴷⴷⴰⴷ ⵙ ⵜⵎⴰⵜⴰⵔⵜ : (ⵇⵇⴰⵃ ⵜⵉⵖⴰⵡⵙⵉⵡⵉⵏ ⴷ ⴷⴰ ⵜⴱⵓⵖⵍⵓⵏⵜ)."
"Another key concept of Heraclitus is that opposites somehow mirror each other, a doctrine called unity of opposites.","ⵢⴰⵏ ⵓⵔⵎⵎⵓⵙ ⴰⴳⵊⴷⴰⵏ ⵏⵏⵉⴹⵏ ⵏ ⵀⵉⵔⴰⴽⵍⵉⵜⵓⵙ ⵉⴳⴰ ⵜ ⴰⴷ ⵜⵜⵓⵙⵎⵍⴰⵍⵍⵉⵏ ⵉⵏⴳⵔ ⴰⵜⵙⵏ ⵙ ⴽⵔⴰ ⵏ ⵜⵖⴰⵔⴰⵙⵜ, ⵉⴳⴰ ⵜⴰⴱⵔⵉⴷⵜ ⵙ ⵡⴰⵙⵙⴰⵖ ⵏ ⵜⴰⴼⵔⴷⵉⵙⵜ ⵏ ⵜⵓⵣⵍⵜ."
Heraclitus' doctrine on the unity of opposites suggests that unity of the world and its various parts is kept through the tension produced by the opposites.,ⴰⵔ ⵜⵎⵎⴰⵍⴰ ⵜⵖⴰⵔⴰⵙⵜ ⵏ ⵀⵉⵔⴰⴽⵍⵉⵜⵓⵙ ⵙ ⵎⴰⴷ ⵉⵥⵍⵉⵏ ⵙ ⵜⴼⵔⴷⵉⵙⵜ ⵏ ⵜⵓⵣⵓⵍⵜ ⵎⴰⵙⴷ ⵜⴰⴼⵔⴷⵉⵙⵜ ⵏ ⵓⵎⴰⴹⵍ ⴷ ⵉⴳⵣⵣⵓⵎⵏ ⵏⵏⵙ ⵢⴰⴹⵏ ⵍⵍⴰⵏⵜ ⴱⴷⴷⴰⵏⵜ ⵅⴼ ⴳⴰⵔ ⴰⵎⵙⴰⵙⴰ ⴷ ⵉⴽⴽⴰⵏ ⵜⵓⵣⵍⵜ.
"A fundamental idea in Heraclitus is logos, an ancient Greek word with a variety of meanings; Heraclitus might have used a different meaning of the word with each usage in his book.","ⵜⴰⵡⵏⴳⵉⵎⵜ ⵜⴰⴳⵊⴷⴰⵏⵜ ⴷⴰⵔ ⵀⵉⵔⴰⴽⵍⵉⵜⵓⵙ ⵜⵜⵓⵙⴳⵣⴰⵍ ⴳ ⵜⵎⴰⵜⴰⵔⵉⵏ, ⵍⵍⵉ ⵉⴳⴰⵏ ⵢⴰⵜ ⵜⴳⵓⵔⵉ ⵜⴰⵢⵓⵏⴰⵏⵉⵢⵜ ⵜⴰⵣⴰⵢⴽⵓⵜ ⵢⵓⵙⵉⵏ ⴽⵉⴳⴰⵏ ⵏ ⵉⵏⴰⵎⴽⵏ ⵉⵎⵢⴰⵏⴰⵡⵏ ; (ⵀⵉⵔⴰⴽⵍⵉⵜⵓⵙ) ⵄⵏⵉⵖ ⵉⵙⵙⵎⵔⵙ ⴰⵏⴰⵎⴽ ⵢⴰⴹⵏ ⵉ ⵜⴳⵓⵔⵉ ⴳ ⵎⴰⵜⵜⴰ ⵓⵙⵙⵎⵔⵙ ⵉⵍⵍⴰⵏ ⴳ ⵓⴷⵍⵉⵙ ⵏⵏⵙ."
Some decades later he had to flee Croton and relocate to Metapontum.,ⴷⴼⴼⵉⵔ ⵏ ⴽⵔⴰ ⵏ ⵉⵙⴳⴳⵯⴰⵙⵏ ⵉⵇⵇⴰⵏ ⴷ ⴼⵍⵍⴰⵙ ⴰⴷ ⵉⵔⵡⵍ ⵙⴳ ⴽⴰⵔⵜⵓⵏ ⵉⵎⵎⵓⵜⵜⵉ ⵙ ⵎⵉⵜⴰⵃⵓⵏⵜⵓⵎ.
"They advanced his ideas, reaching the claim that everything consists of numbers, the universe is made by numbers and everything is a reflection of analogies and geometrical relations.","ⵀⴰⵜ ⴰⵜⵜⵓⵢⵏ ⵙ ⵜⵡⵏⴳⵉⵎⵉⵏ ⵏⵏⵙ, ⴰⵍⵉⴳ ⵍⴽⵎⵏ ⴰⴷ ⵜⵜⵉⵏⵉⵏ ⵎⴰⵙⴷ ⵎⴰⵕⵕⴰ ⵜⵉⵖⴰⵡⵙⵉⵡⵉⵏ ⴳⴰⵏⵜ ⴰⴽⴽⵯ ⵓⵟⵟⵓⵏⵏ, ⴰⵎⵖⵔⴰⴷ ⵉⵜⵜⵓⴳⴰ ⵙ ⵡⵓⵟⵟⵓⵏ ⴷ ⴰⵢⵏⵏⴰ ⵇⵇⴰⵃ ⵉⵍⵍⴰⵏ ⵉⴳⴰ ⵢⴰⵏ ⵡⵓⵖⵓⵍ ⵏ ⵓⵙⵖⴰⵍ ⴷ ⵜⵣⴷⴰⵢⵉⵏ ⵜⵉⵏⵣⴳⴰⵏⵉ."
"Their way of life was ascetic, restraining themselves from various pleasures and food.","ⵜⴰⵎⴰⵎⴽⵜ ⵏ ⵜⵓⴷⵔⵜ ⵏⵏⵙⵏ ⵜⵍⵍⴰ ⵜⴼⵓⵍⴽⵉ, ⴷⴰ ⵙⴱⴷⴷⴰⵏ ⵉⵅⴼⴰⵡⵏ ⵏⵏⵙⵏ ⵙⴳ ⵎⴰⵜⵜⴰ ⵉⴼⵊⵊⵉⵊⵏ ⴷ ⵡⵓⵜⵜⵛⵉ."

"According to Aristotle and Diogenes Laertius, Xenophanes was Parmenides' teacher, and it is debated whether Xenophanes should also be considered an Eleatic.","ⵙⵓⵙⵓⵍⴼ ⵏ ⴰⵕⵙⵟⵓ ⴷ ⴷⵢⵓⵊⵉⵏⵙ ⵍⴰⵢⵔⵜⵢⵓⵙ, ⵉⴳⴰ ⴰⵡⴷ ⵣⵉⵏⵓⴼⴰⵏⵙ ⴰⵙⵍⵎⴰⴷ ⵏ ⵃⵉⵔⵎⴰⵏⴷⵉⵙ, ⴰⵔ ⵉⵙⴳⴷⴰⵍ ⵉⵙ ⵏⵖⵢ ⴰⴷ ⵉⴳ ⵣⵉⵏⵓⴼⴰⵏⵙ ⵉⵍⵢⴰⵜⵉⴽⵉ."
He was the first to deduce that the earth is spherical.,ⵉⴳⴰ ⴰⵎⵣⵡⴰⵔⵓ ⵏⵏⴰ ⵉⵙⴼⵍⴰⵏ ⵎⴰⵙ ⵉⴳⴰ ⵡⴰⴽⴰⵍ ⴰⵇⵍⴰⵍⵍⴰⵢ.
"Parmenides wrote a hard to interpret poem, named On Nature or On What-is, that substantially influenced later Greek philosophy.","ⵢⵓⵔⴰ ⴱⵉⵔⵎⴰⵏⴷⵙ ⵢⴰⵜ ⵜⵎⴷⵢⴰⵣⵜ ⵉⵛⵇⵇⴰ ⵓⵙⵙⴼⵔⵓ ⵏⵏⵙ ⵙ ⵓⵣⵡⵍ ⵏ ⵓⴳⴰⵎⴰ ⵏⵖ ⴰⵢⵏⵏⴰ ⴳⵉⵙ ⵉⵍⵍⴰⵏ, ⴷ ⵜⵏⵏⴰ ⵉⴹⵉⵚⵏ ⴱⴰⵀⵔⴰ ⴳ ⵜⴼⵍⵙⴰⴼⵜ ⵜⴰⵢⵓⵏⴰⵏⵉⵢⵜ ⴷ ⵉⴷⴷⴰⵏ."
"The poem consists of three parts, the proem (i.e., preface), the Way of Truth and the Way of Opinion.","ⵜⴱⴹⴰ ⵜⵎⴷⵢⴰⵣⵜ ⵅⴼ ⴽⵕⴰⴹ ⵉⴳⵣⵣⵓⵎⵏ, ⵜⵉⵣⵡⵓⵔⵉ, ⴷ ⵜⴰⴱⵔⵉⴷⵜ ⵏ ⵜⵉⴷⵜ ⴷ ⵜⴱⵔⵉⴷⵜ ⵏ ⵜⴰⵏⵏⴰⵢⵜ."
"The Way of Truth was then, and is still today, considered of much more importance.","ⵜⴳⴰ ⵜⴱⵔⵉⴷⵜ ⵏ ⵜⵉⴷⵜ ⴳ ⵜⵉⵣⵉ ⵏⵏⴰⵖ, ⴷ ⵜⵙⵓⵍ ⵙ ⴷⵖⵉ, ⵜⵍⵍⴰ ⵜⴳⴰ ⵜⴰⴳⵊⴷⴰⵏⵜ ⴱⴰⵀⵔⴰ."
"Hence, all the things that we think to be true, even ourselves, are false representations.","ⵙⴳ ⴷⴰ ⵀⴰⵏ ⴰⵢⵏⵏⴰ ⵙ ⵏⵜⵜⵉⵖⵉⵍ ⵉⵙ ⵉⵙⵙⴰⵖ, ⴰⵡⴷ ⴳ ⵉⵖⴼⴰⵡⵏ ⵏⵏⵖ, ⵉⴳⴰ ⵅⵙ ⵉⵙⵎⴷⵢⴰⵜⵏ ⵏ ⵄⵏⵡⴰ."
"The goddess teaches Kouros to use his reasoning to understand whether various claims are true or false, discarding senses as fallacious.","ⵉⵙⵙⵏ ⵡⴰⴽⵓⵛ ⵏ ⴽⵔⵓⵙ ⴰⴷ ⵉⵙⵙⵎⵔⵙ ⵜⴰⵡⵏⴳⵉⵎⵜ ⴰⴼⴰⴷ ⴰⴷ ⵉⵔⵎⵙ ⵉⵙ ⵙⵙⴰⵖⵏ ⵉⵖⵉⵍⵏ ⵏⵏⵙⵏ ⵉⵎⵣⴰⵔⴰⵢⵏ ⵏⵖ ⵉⵙ ⵣⴳⵍⵏ, ⴰⴽⴷ ⵜⵓⵜⵜⵓⵜ ⵏ ⵜⴰⴳⴰⵢⵉⵏ ⴰⵢⴷⴷⵖ ⵓⵔ ⵖⵣⴰⵏⵜ."

"Indian philosophers developed a system of epistemological reasoning (pramana) and logic and investigated topics such as Ontology (metaphysics, Brahman-Atman, Sunyata-Anatta), reliable means of knowledge (epistemology, Pramanas), value system (axiology) and other topics.","ⵙⴱⵓⵖⵍⵍⴰⵏ ⵉⴼⴰⵢⵍⴰⵙⵓⴼⵏ ⵉⵀⵏⴷⵉⵢⵏ ⵢⴰⵏ ⵓⵎⴰⴳⴰⵡ ⵏ ⵓⵙⵖⵓⴷⵓ ⴰⴱⴱⵓⵍⵓⵊⵉⵢ (ⴱⵔⴰⵎⴰⵏⴰ) ⴷ ⵜⵓⵏⴳⵉⵏⵜ, ⵣⵣⵔⵉⵏ ⵅⴼ ⵉⵙⵏⵜⴰⵍ ⵣⵓⵏⴷ ⵍⵓⵏⵟⵓⵍⵓⵊⵉⵢⵢⴰ, ⴷ ⴱⵕⴰⵎⴰⵏ - ⴰⵜⵎⴰⵏ, ⴷ ⵙⵓⵏⵢⴰⵜⴰ- ⴰⵏⴰⵜⴰ, ⴷ ⵉⵎⴰⵙⵙⵏ ⵏ ⵜⵓⵙⵙⵏⴰ ⵉⴳⴰⵏ ⵉⵏⴼⵍⵓⵙⵏ, ⴷ ⵓⵎⴰⴳⴰⵡ ⵏ ⵜⵏⴷⵉⵜⵉⵏ, ⴷ ⵉⵙⵏⵜⴰⵍ ⵢⴰⴹⵏ."

"Economic anthropology as influenced by Karl Polanyi and practiced by Marshall Sahlins and George Dalton challenged standard neoclassical economics to take account of cultural and social factors, and employed Marxian analysis into anthropological study.","ⵜⴰⵙⵏⴰⴼⴳⴰⵏⵜ ⵜⴰⴷⵎⵙⴰⵏⵜ ⵉⵎⴽⵉⵏⵏⴰ ⵙ ⵜⵜ ⵉⴹⵓⵚ ⴽⴰⵕⵍ ⴱⵓⵍⴰⵏⵢⵉ, ⴷ ⵉⵎⴽⵉⵏⵏⴰ ⵙ ⵜⵜ ⵉⵜⵜⴳⴳⴰ ⵎⴰⵕⵛⴰⵍ ⵙⴰⵍⵉⵏⵣ ⴷ ⵊⵓⵕⵊ ⴷⴰⵍⵟⵓⵏ , ⵜⵓⴳⵢ ⵜⴰⴷⵎⵙⴰ ⵜⴰⵏⴰⵡⴰⵢⵜ ⵜⴰⵏⵢⵓⴽⵍⴰⵙⵉⴽⵜ, ⴰⴼⴰⴷ ⴰⴷ ⵜⵙⵙⵉⵜⴳ ⵉⴼⵔⴷⵉⵙⵏ ⵉⴷⵍⵙⴰⵏⵏ ⴷ ⵉⵏⴰⵎⵓⵏⵏ, ⵜⵙⵎⵔⵙ ⴰⵙⴼⵙⵉ ⴰⵎⴰⵕⴽⵙⴰⵏ ⴳ ⵜⵖⵓⵔⵉ ⵜⴰⵙⵏⴰⴼⴳⴰⵏⵜ."

"In the 1980s books like Anthropology and the Colonial Encounter pondered anthropology's ties to colonial inequality, while the immense popularity of theorists such as Antonio Gramsci and Michel Foucault moved issues of power and hegemony into the spotlight.","ⴳ ⵉⴷⵍⵉⵙⵏ ⵏⵏⴰ ⵉⴼⴼⵖⵏ ⴳ ⵉⵙⴳⴳⵯⴰⵙⵏ ⵏ 1980 ⵣⵓⵏⴷ “ⴰⵏⵟⵕⵓⴱⵓⵍⵓⵊⵉ” ⴷ “ⴽⵓⵍⵓⵏⵢⴰⵍ ⵉⵏⴽⴰⵡⵏⵜⵔ’’ ⴼⴽⴰⵏ ⴰⵙⵇⵙⵉ ⵅⴼ ⵜⵣⴷⴰⵢⵜ ⵉⵍⵍⴰⵏ ⴳⵔ ⵜⵙⵏⴰⴼⴳⴰⵏⵜ ⴷ ⵜⵎⵢⴰⴳⴰⵔⵉⵏ ⵜⵉⵏⴰⵎⵓⵏⵉⵏ, ⵉⴷⴷⵖ ⵜⵜⵓⵢⴰⵙⵙⴰⵏ ⴽⵉⴳⴰⵏ ⵏ ⵉⵎⵙⵙⵉⵥⵕⵉⵜⵏ ⵣⵓⵏⴷ ⴰⵏⵟⵓⵏⵢⵓ ⴳⵔⴰⵎⵛⵉ ⴷ ⵎⵉⵛⵉⵍ ⴼⵓⴽⵓ, ⵜⴰⵎⴷⵏⴰⵏⵜ ⵏⵏⵙⵏ ⵜⵙⵙⵓⴼⵖ ⴷ ⵙ ⴰⵙⵉⴷⴷ ⵉⵙⵇⵙⵉⵜⵏ ⵉⵍⵍⴰⵏ ⴳⵔ ⵓⵡⴰⵏⴽ ⴷ ⵓⴱⵔⵙⴽⵉⵍ."

"To establish connections that will eventually lead to a better understanding of the cultural context of a situation, an anthropologist must be open to becoming part of the group, and willing to develop meaningful relationships with its members.","ⴰⴼⴰⴷ ⴰⴷ ⵉⵙⴽⵓ ⵜⵉⵣⴷⴰⵢⵉⵏ ⵏⵏⴰ ⵉⵖⵉⵏ ⴰⴷ ⵉⵙⵙⵉⵡⴹⵏ ⵙ ⵢⴰⵏ ⵓⵔⵎⴰⵙ ⵢⵓⴼⵏ ⵉ ⵓⵎⵏⴰⴹ ⴰⴷⵍⵙⴰⵏ ⵏ ⵢⴰⵏ ⵓⵙⵓⵔⵙ, ⵉⵅⵚⵚⴰ ⴰⴷ ⵢⵓⵎⵓ ⵓⵙⵏⴰⴼⴳⴰⵏ, ⵉⴽⵯⵛⵎ ⵙ ⴰⵎⵎⴰⵙ ⵏ ⵜⵔⴰⴱⴱⵓⵜ, ⵜⵉⵍⵉ ⵖⵓⵔⵙ ⵜⵉⵔⴰⵜ ⴰⴷ ⵉⵙⵙⵎⵖⵓⵔ ⵉⵙⵅⵉⵜⵔ ⵜⵉⵣⴷⴰⵢⵉⵏ ⵉⴳⴳⵓⴷⵉⵏ ⴷ ⵉⴳⵎⴰⵎⵏ ⵏ ⵜⵔⴰⴱⴱⵓⵜ."

"In some cases, ethnographers also turn to structured observation, in which an anthropologist's observations are directed by a specific set of questions he or she is trying to answer.","ⵉⴷⵙⵏⵜ ⵜⵉⴽⴽⴰⵍ, ⴷⴰ ⵜⵜⵓⵖⵓⵍⵏ ⵉⵜⵏⵓⵍⵓⵊⵉⵢⵏ ⵙ ⵓⵙⵏⵉⵖⵙ ⵉⵍⴰⵏ ⵜⵓⵚⴽⵉⵡⵜ, ⴳ ⵡⴰⵏⴰⵡ ⴰⴷ , ⵉⵙⵏⵉⵖⵉⵙⵏ ⵏ ⵓⵙⵏⴰⴼⴳⴰⵏ ⴷⴰ ⴷⵉⴳⵙⵏ ⵜⵜⵏⴱⴰⴹⵏ ⴽⵉⴳⴰⵏ ⵏ ⵉⵙⵇⵙⵉⵜⵏ ⵉⵥⵍⵉⵏ ⵉⵣⴷⵉⵏ ⴷ ⵓⵢⵏⵏⴰ ⵎⵉ ⵉⵔⴰ ⵓⵎⵙⵏⴰⴼⴳⴰⵏ ⴰⴷ ⴰⵙⵏ ⵉⴼⴽ ⵜⴰⵎⵔⴰⵔⵓⵜ."

Group cohesiveness (also called group cohesion and social cohesion) arises when bonds link members of a social group to one another and to the group as a whole.,ⵜⴰⵎⵢⴰⵎⴰⵥⵜ ⵏ ⵜⵔⴰⴱⴱⵓⵜ (ⵜⴻⵜⵜⵢⴰⵙⵙⵏ ⵙ ⵜⵎⵢⴰⵎⴰⵥⵜ ⵏ ⵜⵔⴰⴱⴱⵓⵜ ⴷ ⵜⵎⵢⴰⵎⴰⵥⵜ ⵜⴰⵏⴰⵎⵓⵏⵜ) ⴷⴰ ⵜⵜⵉⵍⵉ ⴽⵓⴷⵏⵏⴰ ⴷⴰ ⵙⵎⵓⵏⵏ ⵉⵎⵢⴰⵙⵙⴰⵜⵏ ⵉⴳⵎⴰⵎⵏ ⵏ ⵢⴰⵜ ⵜⵔⴰⴱⴱⵓⵜ ⵜⴰⵏⴰⵎⵓⵜⵏ ⴳⵔⴰⵜⵙⵏ ⴷ ⴰⴽⴷ ⵜⵔⴰⴱⴱⵓⵜ ⴽⵓⵍⵍⵓ ⵜⵜ.
Cohesion can be more specifically defined as the tendency for a group to be in unity while working towards a goal or to satisfy the emotional needs of its members.,ⵜⵖⵉⵢ ⵢⵎⵢⴰⵎⴰⵥⵜ ⴰⴷ ⵜⵜⵓⵙⵏⵎⵜ ⵙ ⵓⵥⵍⴰⵢ ⵉⵙ ⵜⴳⴰ ⵉⵔⵉ ⵏ ⵢⴰⵜ ⵜⵔⴰⴱⴱⵓⵜ ⴰⴷ ⵜⵎⵓⵏ ⵜⵙⵡⵓⵔⵉ ⵖⴼ ⵓⵡⵜⵜⴰⵙ ⵏⵖ ⵖⴼ ⵓⵙⵢⵉⵡⵏ ⵏ ⵡⴰⵙⵙⴰⵔⵏ ⵉⵏⴼⵔⴰⴽ ⵏ ⵉⴳⵎⴰⵎⵏ ⵏⵏⵙ.
Its dynamic nature refers to how it gradually changes over time in its strength and form from the time a group is formed to when a group is disbanded.,ⵜⴰⴳⴰⵎⴰ ⵏⵏⵙ ⵜⴰⴷⵉⵏⴰⵎⵉⴽⵜ ⴷⴰ ⵜⵜⵓⵖⵓⵍ ⵙ ⵜⴱⵔⵉⴷⵜ ⵍⵍⵉ ⵙ ⵜⵜⵏⴼⴰⵍ ⵉⵎⵉⴽ ⵙ ⵉⵎⵉⴽ ⴰⴽⴷ ⵡⴰⴽⵓⴷ ⴳ ⵜⵣⵎⵔⵜ ⵏⵏⵙ ⴷ ⵜⴰⵍⵖⴰ ⵏⵏⵙ ⵙⴳ ⵉⵎⵉⵔ ⵍⵍⵉ ⴳ ⵜⵍⵍⴰ ⵜⵔⴰⴱⴱⵓⵜ ⴰⵔ ⵓⵔ ⵜⵉⵍⵉ ⵜⵔⴰⴱⴱⵓⵜ.

"Group cohesion is similar to a type of group-level attraction which, according to Hogg, is known as social attraction.","ⵜⴰⵎⵢⴰⵎⴰⵥⵜ ⵏ ⵜⵔⴰⴱⴱⵓⵜ ⵜⵔⵡⴰⵙ ⵢⴰⵏ ⵡⴰⵏⴰⵡ ⵏ ⵓⵍⴷⴰⵢ ⴳ ⵓⵙⵡⵉⵔ ⵏ ⵜⵔⴰⴱⴱⵓⵜ ⵍⵍⵉ, ⵖⵓⵔ ⵀⵓⴳ, ⵉⵜⵜⵢⴰⵙⵙⴰⵏⵏ ⵙ ⵢⵉⵙⵎ ⵏ ⵓⵍⴷⴰⵢ ⴰⵏⴰⵎⵓⵏ."
"Lott and Lott (1965) who refer to interpersonal attraction as group cohesiveness conducted an extensive review on the literature and found that individuals' similarities in background (e.g., race, ethnicity, occupation, age), attitudes, values and personality traits have generally positive association with group cohesiveness.","ⵍⵓⵜ ⴷ ⵍⵓⵜ (1965), ⵍⵍⵉ ⵉⵙⵏⵓⵎⵍⵏ ⴰⵍⴷⴰⵢ ⵉⵏⴳⵔⵡⵓⴷⵎⴰⵡⴰⵏⵏ ⵏ ⵜⵎⵢⴰⵎⴰⵥⵜ ⵏ ⵜⵔⴰⴱⴱⵓⵜ, ⵙⵙⴽⵔⵏ ⵢⴰⵏ ⵢⵉⵔⵉⵎ ⵉⵖⵓⴱⴰⵏ ⵖⴼ ⵡⴰⵔⵔⴰⵜⵏ ⴰⴼⵏ ⵏⵏ ⵉⵙ ⴷ ⵓⴳⴳⵉⴷⵏ ⵍⵍⵉ ⵉⵙⵙⵏⴽⴰⴷⵏ ⵜⵉⵔⵡⴰⵙⵉⵏ ⴳ ⵓⵙⵡⵉⵔ ⵏ ⵜⵎⵣⵡⵓⵔⴰ (ⵙ ⵓⵎⴷⵢⴰ, ⴰⵥⵖⵕ, ⴰⵙⴰⵍⴰ ⵉⵜⵏⵉ, ⵜⴰⵣⵣⵓⵍⵜ, ⴰⵡⴰⵜⴰⵢ), ⴰⴷⴷⴰⴷⵏ, ⵜⵉⵏⴷⵉⵜⵉⵏ ⴷ ⵜⴼⵔⴰⵙ ⵏ ⵜⵉⵡⵡⵓⵔⴽⴰ ⴷⴰ ⵜⵜⵉⵍⵉⵏ ⴳ ⵓⵎⴰⵜⴰ ⵢⴰⵜ ⵜⵎⵙⵎⵓⵏⵜ ⵜⵓⵎⵏⵉⴳⵜ ⴰⴽⴷ ⵜⵎⵢⴰⵎⴰⵥⵜ ⵏ ⵜⵔⴰⴱⴱⵓⵜ."
"In addition, similar background makes it more likely that members share similar views on various issues, including group objectives, communication methods and the type of desired leadership.","ⵓⴳⴳⴰⵔ, ⵜⵉⵎⵣⵡⵓⵔⴰ ⵉⵎⵎⵔⵡⴰⵙⵏ ⴷⴰ ⵙⵙⴽⴰⵔⵜ ⴰⴷ ⵉⵎⵉⵍ ⵓⴳⴳⴰⵔ ⴰⴷ ⵛⵛⵓⵔⵏ ⵉⴳⵎⴰⵎⵏ ⵏ ⵜⵉⵏⵇⵇⴰⴹ ⵉⵎⵎⵔⵡⴰⵙⵏ ⵖⴼ ⴽⵉⴳⴰⵏ ⵏ ⵜⵖⴰⵡⵙⵉⵡⵉⵏ, ⴳ ⴰⵎⵓⵏ ⵉⵡⵜⵜⴰⵙⵏ ⵏ ⵜⵔⴰⴱⴱⵓⵜ, ⵜⵉⵖⴰⵔⴰⵙⵉⵏ ⵏ ⵓⵎⵢⴰⵡⴰⴹ ⴷ ⵡⴰⵏⴰⵡ ⵏ ⵜⵏⵙⵙⵉⵅⴼⵜ ⵍⵍⵉ ⵔⴰⵏ."
"This is often caused by social loafing, a theory that says individual members of a group will actually put in less effort, because they believe other members will make up for the slack.","ⵉⵜⵜⵓⵙⵔⴳ ⵓⵢⴰ ⴱⴰⵀⵔⴰ ⵙ ⵓⵕⵓⵎ ⴰⵏⴰⵎⵓⵏ, ⵢⴰⵜ ⵜⵉⵥⵉⵕⵜ ⵉⵜⵜⵉⵏⵉⵏ ⵉⵙ ⵔⴰⴷ ⵙⵙⴽⵔⵏ ⵉⴳⵎⴰⵎⵏ ⵏ ⵜⵔⴰⴱⴱⵓⵜ ⴷⵔⵓⵙⵜ ⵏ ⵜⵣⵎⵎⴰⵔ, ⴰⵛⴽⵓ ⴷⴰ ⵜⵜⵖⴰⵍⵜ ⵉⵙ ⵔⴰⴷ ⵜⵜⴽⵓⵔⵏ ⵡⵉⵢⵢⴰⴹ ⵉⴳⵎⴰⵎⵏ ⵏ ⵜⵔⴰⴱⴱⵓⵜ ⵜⵓⴳⴰⵡⵜ ⴰ."
Most meta-analyses (studies that have summarized the results of many studies) have shown that there is a relationship between cohesion and performance.,ⴰⵎⴰⵜⴰ ⵏ ⴷⴷⴼⵉⵔ ⵉⴼⵙⴰⵢⵏ (ⵜⵉⵣⵔⴰⵡⵉⵏ ⵍⵍⵉ ⵉⵣⴳⵣⵉⵍⵏ ⵏ ⴽⵉⴳⴰⵏ ⵏ ⵜⵣⵔⴰⵡⵉⵏ) ⴰⵔ ⵎⵎⴰⵍⵏⵜ ⵉⵙ ⵉⵍⵍⴰ ⵓⵎⵢⴰⵙⵙⴰ ⴳⵔ ⵜⵎⵢⴰⵎⴰⵥⵜ ⴷ ⵜⵉⴳⴳⵉ.
"When it is defined as task commitment, it is also correlated with performance, though to a lesser degree than cohesion as attraction.","ⴽⵓⴷⵏⵏⴰ ⵉⵜⵜⵓⵙⵎⵍ ⵙ ⵜⵓⵇⵇⵏⴰ ⵉ ⵜⵎⵙⴽⵔⵜ, ⴷⴰ ⴰⵡⴷ ⵉⵜⵜⴰⴳⵍ ⵙ ⵜⵉⴳⴳⵉ, ⵎⴰⵛⴰ ⵙ ⵜⴰⴷⵔⵙⵉ ⵖⴼ ⵜⵎⴰⵢⴰⵎⴰⵥⵜ ⵉⴳⴰⵏ ⴰⵍⴷⴰⵢ."
"However, some groups may have a stronger cohesion-performance relationship than others.","ⵎⴰⵛⴰ, ⵉⴷⵙⵏⵜ ⵜⵔⵓⴱⴱⴰ ⵖⵉⵢⵏⵜ ⴰⴷ ⵉⵍⵉⵏⵜ ⵉⵎⵢⴰⵙⵙⴰⵜⵏ ⵏ ⵜⵎⵢⴰⴰⵥⵜ-ⵜⵉⴳⴳⵉ ⵉⴷⵓⵙⵏ ⵓⴳⴳⴰⵔ ⵏ ⵜⵉⵢⵢⴰⴹ."
There is some evidence that cohesion may be more strongly related to performance for groups that have highly interdependent roles than for groups in which members are independent.,ⵍⵍⴰⵏ ⵡⴰⵏⵥⴰⵜⵏ ⵉⵙ ⵜⵖⵉⵢ ⵜⵎⵢⴰⵎⴰⵥⵜ ⴰⴷ ⵜⴰⴳⵍ ⵙ ⵜⵉⴳⴳⵉ ⵖⵓⵔ ⵜⵔⵓⴱⴱⴰ ⵍⵍⵉ ⵉⵍⴰⵏ ⵜⵉⵎⵍⴰⵍⵉⵏ ⵎⵢⴰⴳⴰⵍⵏⵉⵏ ⴱⴰⵀⵔⴰ ⵖⵓⵔ ⵜⵔⵓⴱⴱⴰ ⵍⵍⵉ ⵎⵉ ⵓⴳⵍⵏ ⵉⴳⵎⴰⵎⵏ ⵏⵏⵙ.

"For example, if an organism could survive well and reproduce rapidly, but its offspring were all too small and weak to survive, this organism would make little genetic contribution to future generations and would thus have low fitness.","ⵙ ⵓⵎⴷⵢⴰ, ⵉⴳ ⵥⴹⴰⵕ ⵓⵎⴰⴷⴷⴰⵔ ⴰⴷ ⵉⴷⴷⵔ ⵙ ⵜⵎⴰⵎⴽⵜ ⵉⵀⵢⵢⴰⵏ ⴰⵔ ⵉⵜⵜⴰⵔⵡ ⴼⵉⵙⴰⵄ, ⵎⴰⵛⴰ ⵜⴰⵔⵡⴰ ⵏⵏⵙ ⵉⵎⵥⵥⵉⵢ ⵉⴳ ⴰⵎⵓⴷⵔⵓⵙ ⴰⴼⴰⴷ ⵉⵇⵇⵉⵎ ⵉⴷⴷⵔ, ⵀⴰⵜ ⴰⵎⴰⴷⴷⴰⵔ ⴰⴷ ⵇⴰⴷ ⵉⴼⴽ ⴰⴼⵕⵕⵓ ⵏ ⵜⵓⴽⴽⵙⵉ ⵉⴷⵔⵓⵙⵏ ⵉ ⵜⵙⵓⵜⵉⵡⵉⵏ ⴷ ⵉⴷⴷⴰⵏ, ⵙ ⵎⴰⵏⴰⵢⴰ ⵇⴰⴷ ⵢⵉⵍⵉ ⵓⵙⵙⵔⴼⵓ ⴰⴼⴳⴳⴰⵏ ⵉⴳⴳⵣⵏ."

"However, even if the direction of selection does reverse in this way, traits that were lost in the past may not re-evolve in an identical form (see Dollo's law).","ⵎⵇⵇⴰⵔ ⵉⵜⵜⵓⴳⴷⴰ ⵓⵎⵏⵉⴷ ⵏ ⵓⵙⵜⴰⵢ ⵙ ⵜⵎⴰⵎⴽⵜ ⴰⴷ, ⵀⴰⵜ ⵜⵉⴼⵔⴰⵙ ⵏⵏⴰ ⵢⵓⵛⴽⴰⵏ ⴳ ⵓⵢⵏⵏⴰ ⵉⵣⵔⵉⵏ ⵉⵖⵢ ⴰⴷ ⵢⴰⴷ ⵓⵔ ⴱⵓⵖⵍⵓⵏⵜ ⵜⵉⴽⴽⵍⵜ ⵢⴰⴹⵏ ⴳ ⵜⴰⵍⵖⴰ ⵜⵉⵎⵉⵡⵉⵜ (ⵥⵕ ⴰⵣⵔⴼ ⵏ ⴷⵓⵍⵓ)."

"Weierstrass, Cantor, and Heine base their theories on infinite series, while Dedekind founds his on the idea of a cut (Schnitt) in the system of real numbers, separating all rational numbers into two groups having certain characteristic properties.","ⴰⵔ ⵉⵙⴽⴰⵏ ⵡⵉⵢⵉⵙⵜⵔⴰⵙ ⴷ ⴽⴰⵏⵜⵓⵔ ⴷ ⵀⵉⵏ ⵜⵉⵎⴳⵓⵏⵉⵏ ⵏⵏⵙⵏ ⵖⴼ ⵜⴳⴼⴼⵓⵔⵜ ⵜⴰⵔⵜⵎⵉ, ⵉⵙⴱⴷⴷ ⴷⵉⴷⴽⵉⵏ ⵜⴰⵡⵏⴳⵉⵎⵜ ⵏ ⵜⵓⴱⵓⵢⵜ (ⵙⵛⵏⵉⵜ) ⴳ ⵓⵏⴳⵔⴰⵡ ⵏ ⵉⵎⴹⴰⵏ ⵏ ⵜⵉⴷⵜ, ⵉⴱⴹⴰ ⵉⵎⴹⴰⵏ ⵏ ⵜⵉⴷⵜ ⴽⵓⵍ ⵅⴼ ⵙⵏⴰⵜ ⵜⵔⵓⴱⴱⴰ ⵎⵉ ⵖⵓⵔ ⵍⵍⴰⵏ ⴽⴰⵏ ⵉⴼⵕⴹⵉⵚⵏ ⵉⵎⵥⵍⴰⵢⵏ."

"Finally, if all of the digits in a numeral are 0, the number is 0, and if all of the digits in a numeral are an unending string of 9's, you can drop the nines to the right of the decimal place, and add one to the string of 9s to the left of the decimal place.","ⵜⵉⵢⵉⵔⴰ, ⵉⴳ ⵍⵍⴰⵏ ⵡⵓⵟⵟⵓⵏ ⵎⴰⵕⵕⴰ ⴳ ⵡⵓⵟⵟⵓⵏ 0, ⴷⴰ ⵉⵜⴳⴳⴰ ⵡⵓⵟⵟⵓⵏ 0, ⴷ ⵎⴽ ⴳⴰⵏ ⵡⵓⵟⵟⵓⵏ ⴽⵓⵍ ⴳ ⵡⵓⵟⵟⵓⵏ ⵏ ⵜⴳⴼⴼⵓⵔⵜ ⵓⵔ ⵉⵜⴼⵓⴽⴽⵓⵏ ⴳ 9, ⵜⵖⵉⴷ ⴰⴷ ⵜⵙⵓⴳⵣⵣⴷ ⵜⵥⴰ ⴳ ⵓⵢⴼⴼⴰⵙ ⴳ ⵓⴷⵖⴰⵔ ⴰⵎⵔⴰⵡ, ⵜⵔⵏⵓⴷ ⵢⴰⵏ ⵉ ⵜⴳⴼⴼⵓⵔⵜ ⴳ ⵍⵍⴰⵏ 9 ⵏ ⵜⵉⵙⵏⴰⵜⵉⵏ ⴳ ⵓⵥⵍⵎⴰⴹ ⵏ ⵡⴰⵏⵙⴰ ⴰⵎⵔⴰⵡ."

The realization that some basic conception within the existing theory was at odds with reality necessitated a complete and thorough investigation of the axioms and assumptions that underlie that theory.,"ⵉⵇⵏⴻⵏ ⵡⵓⵙⵓⵏ ⵏ ⵉⵜⵙⵏ ⵉⵔⵎⵎⵓⵙⵏ ⵉⴷⵙⵍⴰⵏ ⴰⴳⵏⵙⵓ ⵏ ⵜⵎⴰⴳⵓⵏⵜ ⵏ ⴷⵖⵉ, ⵉⵎⵣⴰⵔⴰⵢ ⵏ ⵜⵉⵍⵉⵜ ⵏ ⵜⵉⴳⴳⵉ ⴰⵣⵔⵔⵓ ⴰⴽⴽⵯ ⵉⴳⵏ ⴰⵖⵣⵓⵔⴰⵏ ⵉ ⵜⵉⴳⴳⵉⵡⵉⵏ ⴷ ⵉⵙⵡⵉⵏⴳⵎⵏ ⵉⵍⵍⴰⵏ ⴹⴰⵕⵜ ⵜⵎⴰⴳⵓⵏⵜ ⴰⴷ."

Mathematicians like Brahmagupta (in 628 AD) and Bhāskara I (in 629 AD) made contributions in this area as did other mathematicians who followed.,"ⴽⴰⵏ ⵉⵎⵓⵙⵏⴰⵡⵏ ⵏ ⵜⵓⵙⵏⴰⴽⵜ ⵣⵓⵏⴷ ⴱⵔⴰⵀⴰⵎⴰⴳⵓⵜⴰ (ⴰⵙⴳⴳⵯⴰⵙ ⵏ 628 ⴹⴰⵕⵜ ⵜⵍⴰⵍⵉⵜ ⵏ ⵍⵎⴰⵙⵉⵃ), ⴷ ⴱⴰⵙⴽⴰⵔⴰ (ⴳ 629 ⴹⴰⵕⵜ ⵜⵍⴰⵍⵉⵜ ⵏ ⵍⵎⴰⵙⵉⵃ), ⵉⵎⵢⵉⵡⴰⵙⵏ ⴳ ⵢⵉⴳⵔ ⴰⴷ, ⵎⴽ ⵙⴽⵔⵏ ⵉⵎⵓⵙⵏⴰⵡⵏ ⵏ ⵜⵓⵙⵏⴰⴽⵜ ⵢⴰⴹⵏ ⵉⴹⴼⴰⵕⵏ ⵎⴰⵢⴰⵏ."
"The year 1872 saw the publication of the theories of Karl Weierstrass (by his pupil Ernst Kossak), Eduard Heine (Crelle's Journal, 74), Georg Cantor (Annalen, 5), and Richard Dedekind.","ⴳ ⵓⵙⴳⴳⵯⴰⵙ 1872 ⵜⵢⴰⴼⵙⴰⵔⵏⵜ ⵜⵎⴰⴳⵓⵏⵉⵏ ⵏ ⴽⴰⵕⵍ ⵡⵉⵢⵔⵙⵜⵔⴰⵙ ( ⵙⴳ ⵖⵓⵔ ⵓⵏⵍⵎⴰⴷ ⵏⵏⵙ ⵉⵔⵏⵙⵜ ⴽⵓⵙⴰⴽ) ⴷ ⵉⴷⵡⴰⵕⴷ ⵀⴰⵢⵏ ( ⵜⴰⵙⵖⵏⵜ ⵏ ⴽⵕⵉⵍ, 74), ⴷ ⵊⵓⵕⵊ ⴽⴰⵏⵜⵓⵔ (ⴰⵏⴰⵍⵉⵏ, 5), ⴷ ⵔⵉⵜⵛⴰⵕⴷ ⴷⵉⴷⵉⴽⵉⵏⴷ."
"Weierstrass, Cantor, and Heine base their theories on infinite series, while Dedekind founds his on the idea of a cut (Schnitt) in the system of all rational numbers, separating them into two groups having certain characteristic properties.","ⵉⵙⴽⴰ ⵡⵉⵢⵔⵙⵜⵔⴰⵙ ⴷ ⴽⴰⵏⵜⵓⵔ ⴷ ⵀⵉⵏ; ⵜⵉⵎⴰⴳⵓⵏⵉⵏ ⵏⵏⵙⵏ ⵖⴼ ⵜⴳⴼⴼⵓⵔⵜ ⵜⴰⵔⵜⵎⵉ, ⵉⵙⴱⴷⴷ ⴷⵉⴷⴽⵉⵏ ⵜⴰⵎⴰⴳⵓⵏⵜ ⵏⵏⵙ ⵖⴼ ⵜⵡⵏⴳⵉⵎⵜ ⵏ ⵡⵓⴱⵓⵢ (ⵙⵉⵛⵏⵉⵜ), ⴳ ⵓⵏⴳⵔⴰⵡ ⵏ ⵎⴰⵕⵕⴰ ⵓⵟⵟⵓⵏ ⵓⵎⴳⵉⵏⴻⵏ, ⴰⵔⵜⵏ ⵢⴰⵟⵟⵓ ⵖⴼ ⵙⵏⴰⵜ ⵜⵔⵓⴱⴱⴰ ⵉⵍⴰⵏ ⵉⵜⵙⵏ ⵉⵎⵥⵍⴰⵢⵏ ⵉⵙⵜⵉⵏ."
